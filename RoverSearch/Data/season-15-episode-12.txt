title: Milhouse Doesn't Live Here Anymore


 ♪ The Simpsons ♪ 
D'oh!
Children, I'm sorry to say one of your lunches expl*ded.
Who has the Little Bunny FooFoo lunchbox?
Um... That would be me.
It's not my fault. I can't afford a better lunchbox 'cause I'm poor.
Shut up! My mom got too fat to work at Hooters!
They won't even let her park cars!
Please, children. Don't be cruel.
Nelson might be poor but I'm sure he has the seven dollars for today's field trip. Um...
Well, actually...
Someday...
Now, I know the rest of us are excited about visiting the Museum of Television today.
Hey, don't tell us how to feel!
Bart Simpson, be quiet!
Hey, that wasn't me. That was... Milhouse?
Milhouse? What happened to my little class coward?
What do you care, Mrs. Krabappel?
Or should I say "Mrs. Crab Apple?" Ha-ha!
"Crab Apple?"
I never thought of that.
It totally works.
Oh, how could I have been so blind?
 Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Toxic barrel rollin'
They're so hot and glowin'
We'll d*e.
Smithers, the board of directors is coming here today.
I don't want them to see Snap, Crackle, and Pop down there.
Sir, there's a big cardboard box out back that could keep them amused.
They could make a fort. No, no.
Just give them each a nickel and send them to Moe's.
Let them while away the afternoon spilling their beer on gullets and trousers while drooling over French postcards.
Hello, I'm lsabel Sanford, the beloved Weezy from The Jeffersons.
At this "museum," you won't see a Michelangelo, but you might see Michael Landon and Beverly D'Angelo.
This blows. Let's sneak off.
Wander away from the group?
Man, you've been huffing from the Bart bag.
To old man Burns, who's paying us to drink because we're embarrassing.
We suck! We suck!
A lot of that went in my lungs.
Attention, American bar devils.
It's our anniversary. Free drinks for everyone.
That's great! I'm honored to drink to Apu and... Apu-lina.
Ah.
You know, Marge and I have an anniversary coming up.
I have given Manjula many gifts including a bouquet of flowers, diamond earrings, and we're going to see Paris Hilton in Paris.
Texas... On our way to Paris... France.
What did you plan to get your wife, Homer?
Well, these charity address labels that came in the mail.
Milhouse, why are you acting so crazy?
Did your imaginary friend try to k*ll you again?
No. Walter's been cool.
 Bart, I gotta say something. And it's not easy.
Well, if it's not easy, don't do it. That's how I got where I am.
Then let's just say I don't care what people think of me anymore.
You mean, up until now you did care?
Then why did you wear that tutu to school last week?
What about all the times I didn't wear a tutu?
Nobody ever brings those up! Now leave me alone!
It's the Paul Lynde, Helen Reddy, Hudson Brothers Easter Special, with guest stars Willie Tyler and Lester, and Nadia Comaneci.
I'd like to hippity-hop on your balance beam.
I don't think you understand the mechanics of heterosexual sex.
Well, circle gets the square.
TV sure has come a long way, huh, Milhouse?
Check it out! I'm riding some guy named lronside!
Ow, my banana! Danger, danger.
Door ajar. The indignity.
The agents got all my money.
I'm bored. Let's go switch the heads on the Cosby kids.
I don't want to go home. I'm not done talking to me.
Just get out this door, rummy, and you're the city's problem.
If you make it through the night, you're welcome back.
Ah. Home sweet home. Now to watch some TV.
Oh... You poor soul. You think that rat is a remote.
Here.
What? Five bucks?
I don't need your "sharity."
I'll dance for my money!
Oh, you poor man. You think you can dance.
I didn't say stop.
Bart, there's something I gotta tell you.
I'm moving.
What?
My mom got a job in Capitol City.
Capitol City? You can't move that far. You're my best friend!
What's your mom making? I'll match it!
It's too late, Bart. My mom's already transferred her 401 K.
No!
Luann, what are you doing?
Look, Kirk. I need a fresh start.
Well, couldn't you get a fresh start by re-marrying your old husband?
Kirk, we are going.
Fine. But you can't take Milhouse. I have visitation rights.
Yes. And you're also supposed to pay child support!
Hey, I thought you said my money was no good.
I said you're no good.
Get in the car, Milhouse.
This isn't over! I'll fight you with every lunch half-hour I get!
Oh! Speaking of which...  it's gonna be tough to be peppy today.
Tell me about it.
Why are your clothes so dirty?
And why do you smell like liquor? Have you been clubbing?
Homie, they're beautiful.
That Chevron Station has the most romantic bouquets.
I feel a swoon coming on. 
Here it is.
I am so wasted.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. We're having a simultaneous pass out!
Well, at least they're not fighting.
Oh! Mmm-mmm.
Right this way.
What's on the menu?
Oh, Bart, I'm sure it's hard to lose your best friend.
You mean Milhouse? Funny little guy.
Afraid of the dark and the light.
Now I've got new friends. Guys who get me.
There's one right now.
Who is it? Is it Ralph?
It is not Ralph.
Hi, Bart. My nose makes its own bubble gum.
Just get in here!
...18, 19, 20.
I found you, Bart!
Ralph, we're playing checkers.
I don't like you, Boy-Mommy!
Hmm.
Oh, loveless loners are so lucky.
There's no way I can afford to give Marge a nice anniversary present.
Oh... You poor man. You smell worse than you did last time.
Hmm.
Hey, buddy, that's nice sign work.
Your penmanship is clear, yet sad.
Hey, I know you.
We met in a police lineup.
Oh, yeah, yeah. You know, number two and number four are an item now?
You don't have to tell me, I was number three.
Listen, you have any pointers for a newbie?
Well, there are six schools of begging.
Bad musician, messed up vet, cripple, fake cripple, religious zealot, and crazy guy.
I think you would do well with crazy guy.
Coke and Pepsi are the same thing! Wake up, people!
Wow. Now that is good crazy.
Oh, no. Oh, no! Oh, no!
Hmm?
Oh, yes!
I never thought I'd have to take a plane to see Milhouse.
Well, I'm sure he'll be happy you came.
 Now departing, No-Frills Airlines Flight 89.
Milhouse, Bart's here.
What up, B?
Milhouse? Ls that you?
Yeah. I gave my looks a new flava.
Suck it in!
Uh... Maybe later.
What up, M-life?
Milhouse, this isn't you.
This is my only chance to be cool!
Now please, let me give you a wedgie in front of these guys.
No way!
Please? I'll be gentle.
Oh, fine.
Wedgie!
Milhouse, you went Cap City on him.
Springfield baby in a diaper, poked his eye with a windshield wiper.
Springfield baby!
I'll always love you, Bart.
Springfield baby!
Bart, honey, it's a nice day. Why don't you play outside?
Outside? That's where me and Milhouse played.
 Hmm.
You know, I think your sister could use a little help washing the car.
You'll be like an owl saying, "Milhouse who?"
"Milhouse who? Milhouse who?"
Hey, Moldilocks. Mom says I'm supposed to help you.
Fine. You can confirm the accuracy of the hose.
You wet your pants!
Shut up! It's a serious problem!
Lise, you are so d*ad.
I'm gonna hit you so hard I'll k*ll your whole family.
Bart, you're in my family.
Shut up!
Homie, I'd like to know what you've been doing after work.
Marge, I'm not gonna lie to you.
I also found this in your drawer.
All the answers you need are in here.
Happy anniversary.
Are these Diamonique? Nope.
Diamondelle? Nope.
Cubic Diamondium? Nope.
Dioxy-ribo-diamondoid?
Close but no cigar.
Just plain diamonds!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
We finally have something to put in the wall safe.
Hostess Twinkies?
I heard if you age them for 1 0 years, they turn to liquor.
Kids, go ride bikes for a while, huh?
Yeah, you heard your mother.
We can't jump this ditch.
Sure we can.
But let me go first.
Everyone knows you're the future of this family.
That's not true, Bart.
Mom and Dad value us equally and...
Ah, you're right. Okay, go ahead.
Geronimo!
Just forget everything you know about gravity.
But I know so much about it.
Just do it!
Geronimo!
Look.
We can go inside.
Ooh! We're like Howard Carter discovering the Temple of t*nk.
Or like when I discovered the school Xerox code. I -4-7.
Just saying it makes my butt feel warm again.
 Arrowheads!
 Pictographs! Bart, this is a Native American burial mound.
 Look! He's picking his nose.
Hey, we shouldn't tell anyone we were here.
This place should be our special secret.
Okay. Shake.
Psych!
There's spiders in your hair.
That's what you call commitment to a bit.
 Mr. Bo-jangles.
Mr. Bo-jangles.
We're all Bo-Jangles.
Who k*ll Bo-Jangles?
Maybe it was you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Remember, my dog up and d*ed. Thank you.
You got your wife the earrings, man. Why are you still doing this?
I want to get a second house, closer to work.
He's taking all our business. We're gonna have to do something.
We never do anything. That's why we're bums.
Hey, you're a woman.
And you're a three-headed devil dog! Devil dog!
Wanna make out?
No one wants to be alone.
"The mound builders"
"worshipped turtles, as well as badgers, snakes, and other animals."
Thank God we've come to our senses and worship a carpenter who lived 2,000 years ago.
Hi, Janey.
Branford Marsalis' car broke down outside your house?
And he's just jamming till Wynton shows up?
Oh...
Um...
Some other time maybe.
Today I'm just hanging out at home.
Hey, Bart. I "borrowed" my uncle's pellet g*n.
You want to go sh**t Apu?
Oh, that does sound fun.
But not today. I think I'm just gonna hang out at home.
Oh, my God. My brother's my best friend!
Oh, my God! My sister's my best friend!
Diamonds. I still can't believe he gave me diamonds.
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the baldest of them all?
One time, I swung all the way around.
You did not.
Well, I know a guy who did.
Who? You don't know him. He lives in Russia.
I can't believe they're hanging out.
Ha! Maybe she'll be a good influence on him.
Or maybe he'll corrupt her.
It won't last.
Brothers and sisters are natural enemies, like Englishmen and Scots, or Welshmen and Scots, or Japanese and Scots, or Scots and other Scots.
Damn Scots! They ruined Scotland!
You Scots sure are a contentious people.
You just made an enemy for life!
Listen, Mr. Hobo, you may not have laundry to wash, but I do.
Now what do you want to show me?
There's your husband, aka Mooch-a-lini, Drooly McGee, Corporal Flashback, etcetera, etcetera.
Homer! 
You're panhandling!
I should've known from that panhandling sign, plus that ticket you got for panhandling.
But, Marge, it was all for you, to buy you all the nice things you deserve.
The flowers, the earrings, the Bob Seger boxed set, which really only needed to be one disk, but the box was nice!
Homer, I don't need fancy things.
And even if I did, this is the wrong way to get them.
And to remind you of what you've done, I'm gonna keep these earrings and wear them at social occasions.
I don't understand.
Well, then maybe you need to buy me a broach.
Bart, I cracked the code of the pictograph.
It says there's a curse on the mound.
Of course I don't believe it... 
Hi, Lisa.
I brought you the Cap City version of Monopoly.
Baltic Avenue is now Wayne Street.
It's awesome!
Milhouse, I thought your mom took you away forever.
I got a court order bringing him back.
The judge said I was the most pathetic person he'd ever seen in court.
Pity custody. Boo-yah!
Repo man. I'm here to take your pants.
Not in front of my son. Please!
You're somebody's father?
Yes, okay?
Oh, boy.
Well, I'm glad to be back.
Those Cap City kids don't think I'm cool anymore.
We were having a sleepover and a robber came and wet my bed.
Then he folded the bed back into the couch and disappeared into the night.
I knew you'd blow it. Now let me show you that mound.
You told him our secret?
Hey, he's my best friend.
Oh. I see how it is.
Great. Then we're all cool.
Since he's been back, Milhouse has had three bloody noses and stepped in dog doo.
 it's always a party with that guy.
Well, it's nice you have your best friend back.
You should hang with us sometime, Lise.
Mmm-hmm. I think I'll go to bed now.
What's wrong? Nothing.
 Boy, are you in trouble.
What are you talking about?
When a woman says nothing's wrong, that means everything's wrong.
And when a woman says everything's wrong, that means everything's wrong.
And when a woman says something's not funny, you'd better not laugh your ass off.
Hey, Lise, you want to play Cap City Monopoly?
Look, just because Milhouse is gone, doesn't mean you have to pretend to be my friend.
Oh, come on. I'll roll the dice for you.
Three, four, five, chance. Pick up a card.
Sheesh.
What? Really?
Yep. Pick up another one.
But it's not my turn.
I'm trying to do something nice, you dink. Pick up a card.
"Bart will defend you when other kids call you a nerd."
No one calls me a nerd.
Trust me, that is a valuable card. Pick up another.
"Bart will give back the Malibu Stacy head you thought was lost."
Oh, Bart, that's really sweet.
Just because I have Milhouse back doesn't mean I haven't learned a few things about being a brother.
I think I'm gonna use this card right now.
Oh... Do I have to?
Mmm-hmm. 
All right.
This is what sitcoms call a "schmaltzy ending," a sentimental capper to leave the aud*ence feeling good.
Usually followed by a little coda to cut the treacle.
Granny, I'm gonna sh**t me some Vietcong.
Yeah? Well, I ain't cooking 'em.
And George Jefferson, wherever you are, we love you and want you to come home.
Well, we're movin' on up.
Movin' on up.
To the east side.
Movin' on up.
To a deluxe apartment in the sky.
Movin' on up  Movin' on up.
To the east side.
Movin' on up.
We finally got a piece of the pie.
Fish don't fry in the kitchen.
Beans don't burn on the grill.
Took a whole lotta tryin'
Just to get up that hill.
Now we're up in the big leagues.
Gettin' our turn at bat.
As long as we live, it's you and me, baby.
There ain't nothin' wrong with that.
Well, we're movin on up.
Movin' on up.
To the east side.
Movin' on up.
To a deluxe apartment in the sky.
