title: Lisa Gets the Blues


Stick close by, kids, and I'll explain everything you need to know about the briny deep.
 I want to see a giant squid attack a sperm whale and battle to the death.
 I want to swim free with the fishes.
 I brought my lucky red swim trunks.
 All right, can the chatter and listen up.
 Here we have the hideous moray eel.
 And over here, we have the tasty but repulsive sea bass.
 Yuck!
 What the hell is that?
 - Bart!
 - 
Come on in.
 The water's fine.
 Boy, you come out of that t*nk right now!
 Do some tricks, Bart.
 - Oh!
 - Stop that.
 It only encourages him.
 Ah!
 Dad, you got to see this!
 
 The Simpsons 
 The Simpso 
 The Simpsons 
 
 
 
Oh, not again!
 
 
 
 
 I nailed it.
 I have tears in my eyes, like when I saw David Attenborough's Blue Planet.
 Did you really watch them all?
 Well, most of the first one.
Lisa?
 - Yes, Mr. Largo?
 - I just want to say 
 - And I just want to listen.
I'm a tuna!
 You really should give up the saxophone.
 What?!
 Oh, I know.
 I know.
 You're fabulous.
 Well, then I shouldn't give it up.
 I mean, what would you say if I said you had to give up teaching music?
not teaching music.
 We can't do the couch gag.
 When is Lisa gonna get here?
 Worry about yourself.
 Why would you ask me to give up the saxophone?
 Lisa, sweetie, I'm afraid this world is filled with Lisa Simpsons.
 - Huh?
 - Bright, talented and doomed to disappointment.
 What you're saying is horrible.
 It's horrible.
 
 Mr.
 Largo, what is going on here?
 I'm trying to encourage a student to give up on her dreams!
 You're crushing it as always, Dewey.
 - 
 - I'll take it from here.
 Now, Lisa, this is for your own good.
 For every Yo-Yo Ma, there's a million Ma-Ma Yos.
 And for every Shaun White, there are a million White Shauns.
 And for every Albert Einstein, there are a million Herman Schmidbergs.
 Okay, so maybe I'll never be great, but shouldn't I try?
 
 No.
 
 
 
 Sleeping people are my canvas.
 
 That's some cutting satire, Simpson.
 Yeah.
 Check out Bill Maher over here.
 
 Ay, caramba!
 Let's see.
 Little Bo Peep?
 That'll traumatize him good.
 Oh, I got it, the perfect one.
 No, not that.
 Anything but that!
 Oh, thanks for your input.
 I'll try to come up with an alternative.
 Put it on.
 - 
Get in there.
 
 
 Sing like we rehearsed!
 The sun'll come out tomorrow More pep!
 Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow There'll be sun!
 Sing until food fills your mouth!
 Tomorrow, tomorrow 
 I love ya tomorrow!
 
 You're always a day away.
 Now get the Wite-Out.
 Leapin' lizards!
 He's right.
 I know it's true.
 I always have.
your mother.
 You're great!
 It's too late.
 I'm quitting music.
 There's a microscope in there, too.
 You can sell it.
 Don't give up your dream.
 When I was little, I dreamed about marrying a dashing prince, and it actually happened!
 You were married before Dad?
 No!
 I mean your father.
 My father.
 So that's Homer, or There's no "or"!
 You can't let someone else's opinion tear you down.
 I want to hear your sweet music, so suck it in and get downstairs right now!
 You're the best.
 You're the best.
 Herman Schmidberg!
 - For the love of jazz?
 - 
 
 
 I can't play!
 I just can't!
 It's in my head, but my hands won't do it!
 What's with her?
 
 Woo-hoo!
 Whoa!
 I'm suffering from beer-tigo!
 Whoa!
 
 You don't have to worry about what's wrong with you.
 Just find out whatever it is, and you can fix it.
 ADHD?
 No, that's Bart.
 OCD?
 No, that's Mom.
 This one's Dad.
 This one's Dad.
 This one's Dad.
 This one's Dad.
 What is the name when you can't perform something that you've practiced four times a week since you were three?!
The yips, named for Dr.
 Augustus Yip.
 A mysterious psychological condition where well-rehearsed k*ll suddenly become impossible.
 Like all mental disorders, the yips are likely incurable.
 Oh, for God sake.
 The yips.
 I have the yips!
 Bart, what happened to your pupils?
 They're Annie'd, okay?
Lisa, you want to play some more?
 No!
 
 
 Lisa, honey, are you okay?
 You barely touched your green disgustos.
 Some nights, there's isn't enough kale in the world to brighten a girl's mood.
 
 Oh, that's a good one!
 - Don't you dare.
 - Okay.
 I have some news.
 My great half step-aunt Eunice Bouvier is turning 100 years old, and she wants us there.
 Is this the aunt who lives in Florida?
 It's not just Florida.
 It's Gainesville!
 I only have two weeks vacation, and I have to spend 'em in Dullsville?
 Gainesville.
 If we have time, we'll take a day trip to Dullsville.
Oh!
 It's my turn to pick the vacation!
 Also, she loves music, so I'm sure she'd like Lisa to play for her.
 Stop it!
 Fine.
 The Simpsons are going to Oh, I can't say it.
 Gainesville.
 I was born in Gainesville, Florida And my father was a tailor And my mother ran a cafe Near the university.
Uh, takeoff is the most perilous phase of air travel. If you're gonna crash, that's when it happens.
 Wait.
 Am I on mic?
Yes, Frank.
 Uh, folks, you were just listening to a new play I wrote Death at 600 Feet.
 Yeah.
 I don't think that's making it better.
 Well, thank you for the note, Scott Rudin.
 I'm sorry to announce that all our TVs are out.
Oh!
 But you're welcome to read our in-flight magazine, featuring an interview with our CEO Hanuki Atanawa.
Oh!
 Maybe we'll have one of those passenger riots that seem to occur every other day on U. S.
 airlines.
 
 - Could I get another seat?
 - No, absolutely not!
 You chose an economy modest ticket.
 Please!
 They're both farting!
 All it would take is a single spark to set this powder keg off.
 
 - 
 - 
Hey, hey, TWA!
 How many flights did you cancel today?!
 Hey, hey, TWA!
Folks, I'm afraid due to turbulence among the passengers, we are gonna have to land immediately.
 Looks like we will not be going to Gainesville.
 
 It is pretty great, isn't it?
 Our new destination is, uh let's see.
 - New Orleans!
 - 
 It's a miracle!
 Everyone wins!
 
 Happy birthday to me Happy birthday to me 
 
 Look, Lisa!
 Isn't that nice?
 The sign's telling you to celebrate!
 What are you celebrating?
 Humidity at a 98%.
 Don't they sound great?
 Yep.
 More musicians better than me.
 Oh, boy.
 You're good at cheering her up.
 I'll take Bart.
 Whoop-de-do.
Hmm.
 
 Well, I appreciate you choosing me, Dad, but I don't know how much fun I'll be.
 I think I can cheer my princess up.
 - I don't think you can.
 - Oh, I think I can.
 I'm a pretty tough nut.
 Well, if you're a nut, I will crack you up.
 Not with puns, I'm afraid.
 - Yes, I can.
 - No, really.
 - You like puns.
 - No, I don't.
 I said cheer up!
 That kind of scares me.
 - Scary "eek" or scary "ha ha"?
 - Why would you say that?
 There is no scary "ha ha.
 " - Yes, there is.
 - No, there isn't.
 - What about scary clowns?
 - Nobody likes scary clowns!
 - Go to your room!
 - I'm in New Orleans!

 - Mom, will you pay for this?

 Now, sweetie, let's find a restaurant for you.
 I don't think my problem can be solved by crawfish and jambalaya.
 I wonder, do they have jazz in New Orleans?
 Okay, Lisa, look at your hero for an hour.
 I'm gonna take a whiz in the cemetery next door.
 
 Okay, who to choose?
 Who to choose?
 Ooh, Etienne de BorÃ©.
 I wish you could talk.
 
 Man, I have been waiting for someone to make that wish.
 What's on your mind?
 My music teacher says there'll always be someone better than me.
 
 Well, that's not the only way to be part of jazz.
 Well, I could be a jazz critic or a music executive.
 Jazz critic?
 Music executive?
 They're nothing but glorified grave robbers.
 Look what I found in one of the graves.
 - Put that back!
 - 
 Lisa, darling, you just keep searching.
 You can find anything you want in New Orleans.
 Except, apparently, statue polish and pigeon poison.
 Thank you.
 And may I ask you, how are things in heaven?
 You know that thing we used to call reefer and you people now call medicine?
 I do.
 Well, they have it up in heaven, and it is mighty fine.
 Mighty fine!
 
 So, any last advice?
 Your father knows best.
 Let's go to a bar.
 - But - Daddy's right.
 Can I sing you out?
 Anything but "What a Wonderful World" please.
 Can you sing "What a Wonderful World"?
 What a horrible world.
Okay, I moved her from crying to glum.
 Now to sh**t for happy.
 I just pray they don't see through her fake I.
 D.
Hmm.
 Well, it's better than his.
 Uh-huh.
 
 Milhouse, anything yet?
 No effect.
 But how's Lisa dealing with her depression?
 Oh, give up on Lisa.
 Wait for Maggie.
 Oh, I don't Wait!
 Maggie likes me?
 Still not working.
 What's not working?
 Uh, Bart's got voodoo dolls of all you guys.
 
 There's no voodoo in Gainesville.
 Their flight got diverted to New Orleans.
 
 
 You hackeyed the wrong sack!
 
 It's working!
 So, has Maggie said anything about me?
 We have a lot in common.
 Same bedtime.
 We both like clapping.
 Ow!
 Ow!
 Ow!
 Come on, we've got to go meet your father.
 Let's go.
 Well, there's no miracle for me here.
 
 Why?
 Don't worry, sweetie.
 No one can see you.
 You're alone in the dark, anonymous.
 - Spotlight?!
 - What?!
 Lisa, would you do us the honor of joining us onstage?
 How do you know me?
 That man is my uncle.
 
 Bleeding Gums Murphy?
 - We called him Oscar.
 - Oscar!
 Oh.
 Oscar Gums Murphy.
 You still play bari sax?
 I wish I could play for you, Bleeding Gums' nephew, but I have the yips.
 Oh, that's too bad.
 Well, could you hold this while I play clarinet?
 Now, could you give the mouthpiece a little kiss?
 I think I see through your simple plan.
 My uncle said you were the most promising young musician - he'd ever met.
 - He did?
 
 It was kind of an insult to me, but he was pretty passive-aggressive.
 So, are you gonna play?
 Yes!
 I want to jam!
 I want to scat!
 I want to riff!
 I want to get down!
 Oh!
 
 
 She's playing.
 You did it, Homie!

 A mother's happy as long as all her children are happy.
 Another one, sir?
 No, that's not my Uh, yeah.
 Uh, this one straight up.
 Aw.
 
Lisa, knock off that racket!
Oh, how I've missed this.
 
 Mr.
 Armstrong!
 - Why does a ghost sweat?
 - I don't know.
 But I would give anything for a new shirt.
 
 I'd also really like to be alive again.
 
 
there is no hole.
 
 
 
 Well, we did it, kids.
 And the best thing is, the next episode will b*at g*n.
 What about all the episodes they made on radio?
 - Have a beignet.
