Mmm. When I die, we should totally get this sandwich place for my memorial.
So good. Mmm. Can’t wait.
Oh, all these people loved Mr. Chase.
His students are taking it so hard.
Yeah, nobody grieves like theater kids.
This is my show!
Why are they singing about computers?
It was a musical about Y2K, which was very scary back then.
Scarier than anything we have now.
The whole show takes place on New Year’s Eve, 1999…

Mom, which one are you?
I was right over here.
In the wings, calling all the shots… as the stage manager.
Mrs. Chase, I’m so sorry for your loss.
Oh, thank you, dear.
Say, look what I found when I was cleaning out Franklin’s office.
My prompt book.
This binder lists all the cues for the entire production.
Oh, Franklin always said you were the heart of the show– that your stage managing was so… zealous.
I definitely ran a tight ship.
But in a fun way everyone loved, obviously.
Oh, yeah, totally.
Super fun.
Of course, I would have loved to have been in the show, except I’m not much of a singer.
But in my imagination, I’ve got the voice of a Disney princess.
Oh…
What a special time.
I’d give anything to feel that magic again.

Wow, honey, those dorks are so excited to be in your show again.
And I will do everything I can to support you… while I’m at Moe’s.
Mwah.
Sorry, Marge, but I got to drop out of the show.
I broke my hip while singing and dancing about feeling young again.
Say, Dad, what if you filled in for Lenny and joined Mom’s musical?
Yeah, then you’d be the most supportive husband ever.
Great idea, kids.
I’m all in, babe!
One pair of super tight dance pants, please!
From this day forward, we are enemies.
Forever and ever.
Forever.
Okay, back on stage– it’s just like we’re teenagers again.
Now let’s start the rehearsal.
Theater!
Wait, we can’t start without Sasha Reed.
She was the star of the show.
Mm-hmm.
She got into Julliard.
Sasha. 
You never forget your first diva.
I’d love to know what she’s been up to.
Well, as your dutiful stage manager, I did reach out repeatedly, but never heard back.
I guess we’ll never know what happened after Sasha left little old Springfield for New York City.
Never say never!

Oh, I can’t believe Sasha came back.
What a career!
I know a famous person that knows what’s his name, who is she, and never heard of him!
Okay, okay, everybody.
It’s so exciting that Sasha is a massive success, but we really need to walk through our blocking.
Let’s make it precise, gang!
Blocking, so important.
That’s what Hal always told me.
Hal Prince.
Boom! Named it!
But before we get into the technical stuff, we need to reconnect as an ensemblé.
Let’s all go to my lake house and do trust falls.
But we have to carve out some time to run lines.
 Marge Bouvier, you have not changed a bit.
Okay, Mom, we’ll run lines, but don’t wait up for us.
Us? What do you mean?
This bonding session is for the cast.
You understand, right?
Oh.
Sure. Of course.
Come on, friends! 
I was wrong. Theater kids are super cool.
Thanks for the hookup, honey.

Anyway, I hope you all remember the best part of rehearsal… brownies!
Are those Margie’s Brownies with walnuts and M&Ms?
It’s true, I do matter.
Look what else I’m included in.
It’s all from our shows.
We were such a tight-knit group.
Remember the tightness of the knitting?
 There’s my old guitar pick.
Oh, I haven’t played guitar since I lost this!
Still works!
Oh, man, this takes me back…

I was unpopular and never knew!
All my best memories are ruined.
I wish I had never done this stupid musical again.
As soon as Sasha showed up, it was like I didn’t exist.
I never liked that Sasha Reed.
Taking pop out of the fridge without asking… getting us sued…
Of course! It’s all Sasha’s fault.
Someone ought to teach that Broadway big sh*t a lesson.

So you don’t know the people you said you knew but who are they?
Marge Bouvier, you’re… mean!
Well, I’m sure you’re all as angry at Sasha as I am, but now we can wipe the slate clean and really come together as a theater family.
Without Sasha, there’s no show.
You ruined everything, you… techie!
But, w-w-wait. She made it all up.
She’s a liar!
I think this is the kind of thing that makes people not want to invite you to stuff.
Stupid, ungrateful cast.
Did you sleep at all last night?
“We don’t care that Sasha’s a liar.”
“We still love her more than you.”
Mo-om! Bart replaced my Kashi cereal with woodchips from the hamster cage!
So? You didn’t notice till I told you.
What’s wrong with Mom?
Well, kids, your mother has severely pissed off all the theater weirdos– of which I am now one– but she can’t see it’s her fault.
So… are you gonna tell her?
Indeed I am, and there’s only one way to do it.

You need to let me see the cast-only text chain.
Yeah, I don’t know.
It’s really not cool for me to share it.
Plus, you wouldn’t get any of the jokes.
You might want to skip over the stuff with your name in it.
Sasha hasn’t left town.
There’s still time.
Why would Marge do that to me?
I was never mean to her.
I never even talked to her!
Yeah, we don’t care that you only sell makeup and that you’re a huge liar.
I miss high school.
Remember the night of the cast party?
You and me… in the hot tub?
That night really happened?
I thought I imagined it.
It was real.
And I’ve never had better.
 Ah…
Sasha! Sasha, I’m so sorry.
Once my husband sang and danced to me about what I did, I felt terrible.
I acted like such a crazy teenager.
All I wanted to do was recapture my glory days, when I could’ve become anything… instead of what I really am, a floor manager at Sephora.
Sales associate.
I guess we both wanted to be stars again.
There she is.
Probably called us here to expose the lies the rest of us put in our playbill bios.
What lies?
I am “thrilled to reprise my role as Steve/Ensemble.”
I was supposed to manage the stage, but instead I just managed to screw everything up.
But there’s still time to put on the best show of the latter part of our lives.
What do you say? Should we give it a try?
Oh, why should we?

Marge, thanks for reminding me how good it feels to be a big fish in a small pond.
I guess that’s why you never left.
Actually, I think it was because my parents couldn’t afford college after a lawsuit from a party you threw at my house but didn’t invite me to.
Such timey times.
Oh, my God, it’s really her.
It’s Marge Bouvier.
Just ask her.
Um, would you please sign my prompt bible?
You know me?
You’re a stage-managing icon!
Would you go to the diner with us?
We’d die to hear some of your stories.
Invited to the diner.
