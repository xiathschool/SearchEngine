Yet somehow I feel guilty.   
That woman won't stop staring at me.   
I'm not surprised, Marge.   
You are a senior home ten.   
   
Do I... know you?   
Margie the Meanie?   
You've caused me enough trouble!   
No! Oh...   
Mom, what don't we know about you?   
Marge Bouvier,   
you ruined my life!   
I never want to see you again!   
- 
-    
That is my old principal.   
Mom, she's treating you like
you were a bad kid in school.   
But that's impossible.   
Unless...   
Well, I... not really.   
You were a bad kid in school!   
High five.
And now you're trying to lie about it!   
-  We're the same!
-    
We're the same! We're the same!
We're the same!   
Oh, I finally have
a parent I am proud of.   
Aw.   
 Marge.   
You must've run into Principal York.   
You made her life a living hell.   
 It started in middle school.   
Middle school.   
That's when we were
sopranos in the choir.   
   
   
Ah! Still got it.   
In seventh grade,
I had to switch schools.

We wear top and bottom eyeliner.   
Check out this tattoo.   
Is that press-on?   
Henna.   
   
They were so nasty to me.   
Ah!   
   
And then one day,   
against a checked-out principal,   
you won them over.   
The mean girls are picking on me again.   
Well, what do you expect me to do,    
start some kind of anti-bullying policy?    
Also no standing during lunch.    
    
    
    
I'll do a lot better with
the next person I hire.    
He'll be a win-ner!    
The new girl did that.    
It was cool.    
Cool girl! Cool girl!    
I am a cool girl.    
Don't check with my old school.    
You pranked the principal?    
I embarrassed her, but I shouldn't have.    
But that didn't stop you
from doing it again.    
    
Oh, my God! We saw the principal's bra.    
We've entered...    
...puberty!    
And again.    
 It's not even grammatical.    
Oh, my God, Mom, you're not perfect.    
- You're so not perfect.

you've ever hugged me back.

Call the fire marshal.    
I want to buy a Batman.    
Um, not so fast. Which era?    
Which artist? Dark Knight or Adam West?    
 Sometimes I regret
not finishing medical school.    
I was one credit away. One.    
I want the one where
Batman eats lasagna.    
That is Garfield,
who is not a bat, but a cat.    
How can someone with such
a big head be so stupid?    
That is so cruel,
picking on that poor Wiggum boy.    
Someone should teach him a lesson.    
Someone who's not afraid    
to be a hero to her son.    
Do it, Marge. Prank that guy.    
Superman?    
Uh, for legal reasons,
you can call me Uber Hombre.    
Once again the lack of clear copyright    
in my country has screwed me.    
My copyright expired.    
Would you like to be
the Scarlet Pimpernel?    
No, thank you.    
Maybe something should be done.    
Aw.    
Why, look, if it isn't Lex Loser.    
Ha. Stop working the package to see    
what the middle comic
is in the three-pack.    
Take your chances like a man.    
But I want to see if the
middle one is valuable.    
The middle comic is never valuable.

You serve snacks?    
For valued customers, yes.

What's so funny?    
 Mom and I...    
    
...did a prank together.    
Shh! Sweetie.    
Whoa, wait a minute.    
So Bart gets his wild side    
from his mother? That makes no sense.    
Boys get stuff from their dads,    
like their favorite baseball team,
mental disorders,    
and the lame joke
they tell every waiter.    
Say, Maggie?    
Why don't you get this one?    
Ha-ha-ha.    
Imagine, a baby paying a check.    
Well, maybe Bart's pranking allele    
is on the maternal chromosome.    
 The only part
of that I understood    
was "allele."    
I'm talking Mendelian genetics.    
Young lady, we do not discuss
that at the dinner table.    
Now pass the peas.    
Hmm. How come one quarter are yellow?    
- 
-     
So Bart's not like me,    
Lisa's not like me.    
There will be no evidence
I was ever on this earth.    
Wait, wait. Maybe Maggie.    
    
    
How many times I got to tell you, Homer?    
No outside peas.    
It's just that I realized the
kids totally take after Marge.    
- Nothing from me.
- Come on, Homer.    
There's got to be something
you passed on to your kids.    
That adorable way you pout?    
    
Uh, the way you can burp-sing    
the national anthem?    
Great chiming in today, guys.    
- Oh, thanks for noticing.
- Appreciate it.    
There is something
we have in common, Dad.    
That we're both made out of beer?    
No, something deeper. Profound.    
Dark beer?    
You'll have to figure it out yourself.    
Oh, I hate when foam makes me think.    
Hey, you guys have forgotten one thing.    
Lisa Simpson.    
She is    % scientific proof    
that I exist.    
To Lisa "What's Her Middle Name"
Simpson.    
Daddy's little girl.    
No clinking? What's wrong?    
Yeah, well, truth be told,    
uh, none of us was positive
Lisa was really your kid.    
She's smart as a whip.    
- Wha...?
- She can control her temper.    
- Why, you...!
- You look exactly like her    
if she was a big, fat,
bald guy, which she's not.    
- In the least.
- For your information,    
I'm gonna find a wonderful bond    
between myself and my little girl.    
And you childless loners
are gonna be so jealous.    
You losers will never have this!

- Losers!    
Oh, right, Maggie's in the car.    
Shut the damn door!    
Marge, I see you're buying    
Slaughterhouse Sweepins brand hot dogs.    
It must be so easy to shop    
when anything's good enough
for your family.     
Eh? Eh?    
No. No more pranking.

 Vegetarians like food?    
Is that pulled pork
dripping with cheese?    
Uh, yes, except instead of cheese,    
I'm using cashew paste
with nutritional yeast    
and for pork,
I'm substituting jackfruit.    
No pork?    
Jackfruit is vegan, abundant,    
and no plucking, so it's cruelty-free.    
Try some.    
Hmm, not bad, not bad.

Oh, sweetie, I love this meal.

Oh, thank God I keep
an emergency sausage

Ew, what is this?    
It's a ground-up kickball.

Why, you little...!     
Ow!    
    
Ow! Ow! Ooh! See, Marge?    
That's why we shouldn't
have books in the house.    
Do you think I like doing this pranking?    
When I'm done laughing, I hate myself.    
I'm behaving like a little brat    
and it's made me a better mother.    
But pranking isn't like you,
it's like me.    
We can't have two of me
in this marriage.    
One of me is enough for three of us.    
But I can't stop,
'cause I've never been closer to Bart.    
I've waited for a connection
like this for so long.    
Longer than the new Avatar movie.    
It's coming, Marge.    
You've got to have faith.    
You sound like James Cameron, Homer.    
What if we never see Pandora again?
