title: Bart's in Jail


♪ ♪  
We sure lucked out with this new gig.  
Half day on Christmas,
unpaid polio leave,  
and all the bread crumbs you can sweep.  
Mac, we just got our first paychecks.  
Take this money and turn
it into giggle water.  
 FICA?!  
What the hell is that?  
Eh, that's your Social Security tax.   
Government takes our money,   
then gives it back when
you retire in    years.   
What? Stupid government
thinks it's smarter than me.   
I can handle my money.   
Put five bucks on any
two animals fighting.   
And I'll eat the loser.   
We're not gonna need Social Security.   
We're gonna be rich.   
Yeah, we'll never need government help.   
Help me, government!   
We need our Social Security checks.   
Make rain a modest, fixed amount.

- Now, this is what I call cribbage.   
Abe wins again!   
   
Another great day in the books.   
Now to cap it all off
with a medicated foot bath   
and a nice, deep-ear Q-tipping.   
   
   
   
Hello?   
Grandfather! You've got to help me!   
What? Is that you, Bart?   
That's right. It's me, Bart.   
I'm so scared. I'm in jail!   
- Jail?- Please don't tell my dad or mom.   
They'll be so mad.
The policeman needs to talk to you.   
Sir,
your grandson is in big trouble.   
No, not Bart. My little angel.   
Well, he was arrested for
vandalism and shoplifting, sir.   
Yeah, that sounds like Bart,
that little devil.   
If you don't send his bail
money in the next    minutes,   
he's going straight to the downtown   
juvenile detention center.   
Grandfather! Help me! Please!   
Don't worry, Bart.   
Just tell me what you
need and I'll do it.   
Your Grampa loves you.   
I need to wire some money
to an overseas account   
to bail my grandson
out of an unnamed jail.   
Fill out this form.   
I didn't know my little
Emma was in Colombia,   
let alone working as a drug mule.   
I'm just so thankful the
Russian secret police   
will accept the title to my Lexus.   
Mr. Simpson,
we've confirmed receipt.   
Your grandson will be released...   
Oh, thank God.   
...once you pay his processing fees,   
holding cell costs and handcuff tax.   
It's on its way, plus a little extra   
for you being so helpful.   
Did he reach out to his father?
His mother?   
His dead grandmother?   
No. He came to me.   
Because Bart knew that he
could count on his Grampa   
to get him out of any kind of jam.   
Mm.   
Oh, thank goodness you're out!   
Okay, okay, enough with the smooches.   
I don't care what you've done.
All that matters   
is that no grandson of
mine's gonna go to jail.   
Jail? Are you off your meds
or on new meds?   
Bart, don't you remember?   
I just wired all that
money to pay your bail.   
Whoa, Grampa, I think you were...   
scammed.   
Me, scammed?    
That's impossible.   
No one hornswoggles Abraham J...   
S-I-M-P-S-O-N.   
   -  -    .   
Homer.   
    
I've been hornswoggled.    
You're watching the Punt Zone channel.    
It's nothing but punts.    
Never miss another exciting fair catch    
or thrilling second of hang time.    
It's fourth and long, here's the snap.    
It's a fake punt! Cut away! Cut away!    
Guys, something happened to Grampa.    
I got bamboozled out of my money    
by a flimflam artist.    
It's not his fault. Some scammer    
convinced him I was in jail.    
I'm so sorry, Grampa.    
Um, uh, let me go
microwave your slippers.    
I don't deserve warm toes.    
I'm nothing but a feeble,
useless, old idjit.    
No. You were just trying
to be a good grandparent.    
And one bad apple took advantage of you.    
You got nothing to feel bad about.
    
Bart in jail?
I would have fallen for that, too.    
I mean, how much money
could they have taken    
from a retired, old meatball man...    
   bucks plus a pocketful
of hard candies?    
Here you go, Dad. I'll cover it.
What's the damage?    
Ten thousand dollars!    
    
Where the hell did you
get that kind of money,    
you broken-down old meatball man?    
It's    years of my cribbage winnings,    
saved up in a cigar box.    
I was gonna leave it to you,
and now it's all gone.    
    
No. No.    
No!    
I had an inheritance
and you gave it away?    
I'm so mad I could k*ll you,    
but now I'd get nothing.    
I hope you live forever!    
Now to read Abraham J. Simpson's    
final will and testament.    
To my surviving Homers,    
I leave you $  ,       
- that I never told you about...
-     
- Oh!
- Huh? - Yeah?    
...but then I lost it all to a scam.    
So, because I'm a moron,    
I leave you nothing.    
D'oh!    
Ten thousand dollars!    
 That dream again?    
The money's gone, gone.    
But how can you miss money
you never knew you had?    
to find out you got money,    
but you lost money, so you have it,    
but you don't have it.    
Oh, it's giving me whipcash.    
    
Just think of all the ways my
life could have been better    
with that ten grand.    
Oh.    
So, uh, we're asking
each family to chip in $      
for a new fundraising thermometer.    
Oh, yeah,    bucks...
I would totally donate that    
if my father hadn't given away $  ,   !    
Um, it's just a suggested amount.    
Sure, ten grand might not sound
like much to you teachers,    
but I choose inheriting $  ,       
over earning a million.    
And all of you would do the same!    
Homer, not here.    
Because generational
wealth is the purest,    
most sacred kind of money there is.    
But my father fell for
some super-obvious scam    
because his brain is made of    
powdered mashed potatoes.    
So, no, I will not be donating.    
    
- Oh...
- Marge, if I may, I-I dealt with a similar situation    
with my mother. She got a phone call    
claiming punk rockers were
threatening to cut my hair    
into a Mohawk,
which is a distinctive hairstyle...    
I know what it is.    
This place got us through it.    
Hmm.    
This could be just what we need.    
Oh, uh, sorry,
that's not for you to keep.    
I don't get many business cards.    
Group therapy?
In my day, we dealt with horrible shame    
by getting blind drunk,
stumbling into a hobo camp    
and fighting their king.    
Sometimes it worked,
sometimes it didn't.    
Just give it a try, Abe.    
It'll help to know
that you're not alone.    
 Nice, Marge.    
Making Dad sit through
a pathetic sob-fest    
with his fellow losers is
the perfect punishment.    
There's a group for you, too.    
I...  wish I never voted
to build this community center.    
    
 I should have
known mortgage lenders    
don't take Applebee's gift cards.    
He said if I didn't wire the
money to the power company,    
they'd shut off my electricity.    
I am the power company.    
Catfished. Ooh!    
Now it seems so obvious    
that I would never meet
the real Melissa Joan Hart    
in a online billiards forum.    
These criminals target
the good in all of us,    
so the first step is
to take a deep breath    
and forgive ourselves.    
    
My mother paid hackers to return
her stolen computer photos.    
 They weren't gone.
They were backed up    
to the cloud, Dropbox, Time Machine...    
things of that nature.    
Now, these are the things you
should never say to a v*ctim.    
"I would never have fallen for that,"    
"Everyone knows about that scam,"    
and "What were you thinking?"    
I would have never fallen for that!    
Everyone knows about that scam!    
What were you thinking?!    
No, it wasn't my fault.    
This group taught me not to feel shame.    
I'm on a path of healing
and self-empowerment.    
You better not be.    
Now, what do we say to shamers like him?    
Shaming is blaming.    
Yes,    % agree!    
    
How could you treat Grampa like that?    
You think you're so smart.
Do you really think    
the same thing wouldn't
have happened to you?    
Me? Impossible.    
I'm too savvy.    
This savvy! See?    
Dad, anyone can get scammed. Even me.    
I paid the bullies for wedgie insurance.    
But the minute I got a wedgie, bam!    
I got hit with a deductible...
another wedgie!    
And my rates went up.    
That's why I never get any insurance.    
I got an email saying I qualified    
for the Saxophone Junior Olympics,    
but when I clicked the link,
they hacked my phone    
and stole my Audible listener credits.    
    
You clicked the link?     
That's so... Who clicks the link?    
Even children are being scammed?    
Well, maybe there's a few more
bad apples than I thought.    
But I still have to believe
the barrel is mostly good.    
Oh, Marge, how I envy
your sweet innocence.    
The world is a blender full
of sharks set on extra teeth.    
So you got to be like me...
always on guard    
- so you're never a sucker.

Delivery for Homer Simpson.    
Why'd you buy all these knives?    
They're not knives.
They're the future of cutlery.    
Put 'em in the garage with the others.    
Others?    
- 
- Cutlife is a famous    
multi-level marketing company.    
Dad, you fell for a pyramid scheme.    
Scheme? No way.    
They didn't even want to let me join.    
But, luckily, at the last minute,
a space opened up.    
How many knives have you even sold?    
 I don't sell them.    
I engage opportunity handlers    
to distributize them for me,    
the expandibution manager.    
It's all part of Charles E. Cutlife's    
three-dimensional triangle system.    
- Look!
- BART: Why can't Dad    
ever get arrested in a suit?    
   
you got scammed.    
 She's right. Everyone's right.    
Don't look at my gullible face!     
And so I consign to the flames    
a monument to my own stupidity.    
- No!
-     
Now, isn't there someone
you need to apologize to?    
Maybe your father?    
Yeah, you're right.    
I said such horrible things to him.    
    
All that time I was yelling at you,    
it turns out I'm a sucker, too.    
Will you forgive me, Dad?    
Of course, son. Hopefully, we've all    
come out of this a little more savvy.    
    
Hello? Yes, this is a grandparent    
of a boy or girl.
Sure, put him or her on the phone.    
No! Lisa's in jail!    
Grampa, they're trying
to trick you again.    
 It's the same swindler.    
He must think I'm greedy for more.    
 I got an idea.    
Grampa, you got to keep talking
so that guy stays on the phone.    
Keep talking? I've been preparing
for this moment my entire life.    
Sir, look, if you don't    
put up that bail money,
your granddaughter    
will be spending the
night in the cooler.    
- 
- In my day, we didn't have fancy coolers,    
so everyone took turns blowing
on the meat to keep it fresh,    
unless you hired a Dutch family
to blow on your food for you.    
Breezies is what you'd call 'em.    
    
    
Sir, if you could just    
give us your bank information...    
It was quite the scandal when a breezy    
married a smusher...
those were the fellas you hired    
to flatten your sandwiches
by sitting on 'em...    
and the whole town came
out to throw tar...    
Wow, that's some quality prattle.    
Okay, I've run
all three hours of the call    
through open-source audio software,    
and the unique pattern of church bells    
and roller-coaster screams
pins the location to...    
...ladies and gentlemen,
the address of the scammer.    
Whoa, we could get the money back.    
It's not about the money.    
I want to show that bad
guy the face of the old man    
whose love and decency he exploited.    
Oh, honey, you have a beautiful heart.    
But make no mistake...    
it is about the money!

learn an important lesson:

 No, they don't.
They just grow more wool.    
What are you, a shepherd? Come on, Dad.    
Let's go get my eventual money back.    
How are we gonna get past the guard?    
Aw, don't worry about that.    
My friends can get us in.    
That's the surgical

from the finest Idaho steel.    
Amazing. I'll take the full set.    
Oh, you're not buying the knives.    
I could sell them?    
No, you can sell other
people on selling them.    
These knives sell selling
themselves themselves.    
This is the opportunity of a lifetime!    
I'm gonna go tell my pregnant
wife about my new career.    
Okay, Grampa,
we're gonna find that bad guy    
and get you some justice.    
    
Uh, which one's the scammer?    
They're all the scammer.

Fluff, fluff.    
There's so many of them.    
    
You are all in an unethical industry

 Oh, man.    
Another boiler room of phone hucksters.    
   
you don't got to go home,
but you can't grift here.    
- Come on.
- What? - Really?    
Aren't you going to arrest them?    
Marge, you shut down one of these,    
five more pop up in its place.

- No.    
- Do you have my money?
- Nope.    
Can I have $  ,   ?    
Not gonna happen, dude.    
Hey, you sound familiar.    
Don't have a cow, man.    
Is this what we wanted to happen?    
Okay, I know this seems bad,
but... but, uh...    
Oh, come on, Mom,
you always see the good in everything.    
Well, on the bright side,    
if you look at it a certain way...    
there is no bright side!    
The whole world is one
big criminal organization!    
From hedge funds to
payday loans to the NCAA,    
it's not just a few bad apples...    
it's the whole orchard that's rotten!    
    
Whoa, gift cards!    
Justice wasn't served,    
but dinner is.    
 I can't believe we ate    
$    worth of appetizers.    
Revenge sliders dipped in payback sauce.    
Mmm.    
Honey, you're not sweating
from overeating. What's wrong?    
These gift cards were obtained
by scamming innocent people.    
So no, thank you.    
You said it yourself...    
everyone in the world is
ripping off everyone else.    
Why shouldn't we wet our beaks?    
Oh, you got to try these fried beaks.    
Dip the beak! Dip the beak!    
Well, it seems like
no one else has a problem    
gorging on ill-gotten appetizers.    
Beak me.    
    
With that deep-fried morsel,    
my victory is complete.    
Uh, we're all seeing    
the freak in the sandals, right?     
Yes, but this can't be real.    
We probably just ate too many

Excuse me, I'm out of gas

Would you lend me $  ?    
I'll mail it back to you, I promise.
