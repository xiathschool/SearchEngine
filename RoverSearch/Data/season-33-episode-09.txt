Kids, I love all your presents and...   
Homer?   
Uh...   
This is the one holiday

Well, I was gonna
make you breakfast in bed,   
but you know the food
always comes out bad...   
Ugh, so bad.   
And we always leave
a mess in the kitchen,   
which is worse than making
no breakfast at all.   
Basically we're idiots.   
Hmm. Where is this going?   
So I thought, why not get you
a nice picture frame instead?   
It'll last longer than a breakfast

 Oh, my God.   
I'm so sorry, Homer.   
Nothing can replace your mom.   
But you do have your father.

Hoo boy.    
Mr. Simpson, when you found out    
your mother was alive,
were you conflicted?    
- 
I decided it was time
my father and I had a talk    
about what really happened to my mother.    
    
- You told me Mom was dead!
- She is.    
Why wasn't there a funeral?    
There was too much going on.    
My wife just died, for God's sake.    
Dad, there's something you're
not telling me about Mom.    
Well, son, when a man and a woman    
love each other very much,    
they want to make a
baby that is immediately    
a source of huge conflict.    
Not that. Where is she?    
Well, the truth is, I don't exactly know    
what happened to your mother.    
She's alive and wanted by the FBI    
for some radical hippie nonsense.    
When she said "outta sight,"
she wasn't kidding around.    
- Why did you lie?
- To protect you.    
Protect me from what?    
To protect you from a woman    
who didn't love me enough!    
Oh, my God, I wasn't protecting you,    
I was protecting me.    
From the shame of a wife who left.    
Because I never gave her
what she wanted most,    
which was to leave me.    
And as TV shows have
shown us again and again,    
that moment of self-realization is    
all it takes to cure my alcoholism.    
    
Yippee! God bless ya, son!    
You and I have each other
and that's all we'll ever need.    
- Oh.
-     
This isn't over.    
What did you just think?    
You heard me!    
That must have been difficult.    
How did you deal with your grief?    
I tried everything.    
I went to the guidance counselor.    
I'm torn up inside.    
Have you considered the Army?    
They're always looking for angry,
messed-up young men.    
No, thank you!    
I went to the church.    
It didn't help.    
I lost my mother    
and I can't get rid of the pain.    
Have you considered
another religion? Hmm?    
Then one night, I came to a decision.    
Why did she go to Utah?    
Every kid there already has
more moms than they need.    
I never even got to give this to her.    
Who knows where she ranks now?    
I'm gonna find my mother.

as a perfect woman.    
But... I hate to say this...
she wasn't perfect.    
She hogged the blankets something awful.    
She had a hard-to-remember birthday.    
Please, Dad. I need to know
what happened to her.    
Oh, I can't say no to that face.    
I think everything's gonna
be better from now on.    
Just drive!

through the badlands of Utah,
our relationship    
grew deeper and closer
than ever before.    
Say, boy, are you left-handed or right?

Do you like books or TV?

Who wants to know?    
Let's just say a man
who's had his heart broken

thing to a mother    
was the lady on the
bottle of maple syrup.    
Hmm.

being without companionship of any kind

beneath my crusty exterior
is some sweet apple pie,    
and skip right to the part

Yeah, we sure did.
