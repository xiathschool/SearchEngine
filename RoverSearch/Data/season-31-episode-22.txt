Um... I did it.   
Hit me with the newspaper.   
You know I get my news online.   
Guys... what is Santa's Little Helper doing?   
I think something is very wrong with him.   
I think maybe we should take him to a dog psychologist.   
Dog psychologist, eh?

I have left my wife.    
What? Really?    
You and I have loved each other since primary school.    
She knew that, so I think she was relieved.    
Oh, Clay.    
I'd stopped allowing myself to hope.

No, no! Stay on the call.

You poor boy.    
You've got a story to tell.    
    
Could you teach us to do what you do?    
To see the world through his eyes?    
Oh, not through his eyes.    
That's the point.    
A dog's dominant sense is smell.    
 He sees the world with his nose, and his nose sees so much more than our eyes.    
For instance, we see a lamppost.    
Your dog sees everyone who's ever been here.

Hey. Hello.    
Oh, look at this handsome guy.    
What's up with you, fella?    
Um, he bit my mom.    
Oh, I see.
Well, we've had a cancellation, so if you like, we can just put him down right now.    
- What?!
- No!    
I-I don't think that's necessary.    
Oh, no, I'm afraid once a biter always a biter.    
Unless you, like, train 'em or something, but that's... that's crazy hard.    
Would you like a minute to say goodbye?    
No way. We're leaving.

I guess he's just gonna have to stay in the doghouse    
I built for him.    
- D'oh!
-     
Hey-a, kids.
The vet reported your dog as a biter, so I'm supposed to wait until animal control gets here to take him away.    
- 
- What?    
So, uh, well, while we wait, uh, you want to play Simon Says?    
Simon says don't k*ll our dog.    
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm Simon.    
You're-you're not Simon.    
 Dad! They're coming for our dog!    
I won't let you, you... you big blue balloon.    
Ooh, I like the image.
Hey, imagine me in a parade, huh?    
Oh, boy.    
Oh, darn it.    
You call them and tell them we are not letting you take our dog.    
I can't cancel.
They're already on the app.    
It says they're six minutes away. See?    
Uh-huh.    
Oh, they missed a turn.    
Oh, now they're doing a U-ey.    
Geez, hope this guy euthanizes better than he drives.    
Dad, quick, take our dog and drive as far and fast as you can.    
Yes, sir.

Oh, God, it's too late.    
Dr. Wolff?    
Look, I need to tell you this one thing.    
Something I saw in your dog's eyes.    
He's at breaking point, and unless he has some kind of catharsis, something terrible could happen.    
He bit my mom.    
It is gratifying to be right.    
Oh, how awful.    
Animal control is coming to get him right now.    
You can't stop them.
They got sticks with wire loops.    
Kids, pack his things.    
And I'll need this.
This dog is coming with me.    
Well, I am not leaving here empty-handed.

- No.    
Okay, all right.    
Being a police chief really sucks.

Dad, am I gonna get my dog back?    
Of course.    
But just in case, I know this isn't the kind of thing a father says to his son, but let's pray.    
Almighty patron saint of dogs, Saint Bernard...    
- Oh, can I join in?
- Sure.

Losing our dog, possibly forever, has really brought us together.

Hello?    
The car is here. Tuscany awaits.    
Oh, Clay.    
Ugh, I should have called.    
Darling, I've done something impulsive.    
You know how Mother always wanted you to wear her ring, but she died at a time when we had no hope.    
And in my heartache, I let them bury her with it.    
So I dug her up and, uh, will you marry me?    
I know "exhumed" isn't usually the most romantic word, but...    
Oh, Clay. I can't marry you now.    
But I can meet you in Tuscany in a few weeks.    
I might not be there.    
I can't compete with a wagging tail.    
Goodbye, Clay.    
I want you to know I'm already over you.

You buried this here. Why?    
Is this the key that unlocks your psyche?    
Bark once for "yes," bark twice for "that's too simplistic a view of canine psychology."    
    
Oh, hi. Is that our dog?    
Or one that looks just like it to fool the kids?    
 You're back! Aw.    
Where did this come from?    
Uh, I would have to say the North Pole?    
Wait, Dad?
That was the hat I was wearing the night we got Santa's Little Helper, remember?

- Go, Santa's Little Helper!

Dog of w*r coming up fast on the outside...    
Aw, can we keep him, Dad? Please?    
But he's a loser. He's pathetic.    
He's... a Simpson.    
Santa's Little Helper was a racing dog?    
 Not much of one.
Even I could b*at him.    
Oh, it's all clear now.    
Your dog has PTSD.    
And he has to confront his abuser,    
and he's gonna do it right now.    
Actually, we're in the middle of a holiday brunch, so...    
But I-I'm with you.    
Uh, goodbye, everybody.

I was being sarcastic, naturally.    
    
Not all trainers are monsters.    
Yeah, I remember this mutt.
Uh, Santa's Little Helper.    
Yeah! Hey, what'd you rename him?    
- We didn't.
- Boy, are you lazy.    
He was born to one of the fastest in the business, She Biscuit.    
Oh, he was her favorite.    
And boy, did he love her.    
That's how we learned how fast he was.    
So naturally, we took him from his mother forever.

Ow! Okay, I get it.    
Boy, suddenly, the guy who tortures dogs is the bad guy.    
    
Now what does he want?    
    
Son of a g*n.
