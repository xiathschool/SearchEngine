THE MANSION FAMILY

D'oh! 
Mm-mmm!
Hmm!
Hello, I 'm Kent Brockman.
And I'm teen sensation Britney Spears.
And I'm Kent Brockman!
With Britney Spears!
And we're here to present the-
65th-
Annual-
Spring- field-
Pride A- wards!
Tonight we'll be recognizing outstanding members of- the-
Springfield community.
This is my year, Marge. Everyone knows I'm what makes this city great.
I don't know. There's a lot of buzz around Lenny.
Our first Springfield Pride Award goes to a local legend- a man who brings laughter and joy... to the children of Springfield.
With his big, red nose and baggy pants.
Krusty the Clown!
Hey, hey!
What?.
Who are you?.
Seat filler.
Aw! Hm!
Everyone gets an award but me.
I can't help it if I donated the most bl*od.
Ohh. I 'm feeling kinda woozy.
Oh, why won't anyone give me an award?.
You won a Grammy.
I mean an award that's worth winning!
You know, Kent, in today's youth-obsessed culture... we sometimes forget that older people are still alive.
I told ya!
Well, sorry!
And that's why our final award honors a man... who's lived in Springfield for a hundred and eight years.
Our oldest resident, Cornelius Chapman.
 Cornelius Chapman built the first log cabin in Springfield.... and introduced the toothbrush to our fair city.
 Hey! Not bad!
 In the market crash of 1929... he helped people jump out of windows to avoid disgrace.
You' re doing the right thing. Oh, oh! Out you go!
Ohh!
 My, you're a big one. No, no turning back now.
Yaah!
Off a tall building- That's a great way to do it!
And in 1935, our honoree took a b*llet for Huey Long.
No-o-o!
And now, Springfield's oldest citizen- he is, like, totally venerable-
Cornelius Chapman!
Mm-whaa!
♪ 
Well, guess we should've expected that.
Well, this award has to go to somebody.
Would everyone who is 60 or older please stand up?.
Over 80.
Ninety.
One hundred years old.?
Homer, sit down!
What's that, sonny?.
Uh- This is so sudden.
Da- Uh- Don't give me that kiss of death, you black widow!
 Boy, he didn't want to let go of that!
Now, let's see. I- I don't have a speech prepared.
But, uh, abra-cadaver!
"Thank you all so much.
"I love Springfield, from the cuddliest infant... to the-"
"Puppies." "Patriotism." "Bluebirds." 
I'm not reading this drivel. This speech is over.
♪ 
 Well, that was a great night for us all.
That's not an award. That's part of the set.
Nothing you can say will diminish this honor. 
 Now that I'm the town's oldest man...
I'm starting to realize I'm not a young man anymore.
I have to start taking better care of myself.
You know, I haven't had a "medicine" checkup in ages.
Sir, you deserve the finest doctors in the world.
I 'm taking you to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.
Very well. But I'll need someone to watch my house.
Who's that fellow who always screws up and creates havoc?.
Homer Simpson, sir?.
Yes! The way I figure it, he's due for a good performance.
Now, if the house catches fire...
I want you to call this number.
Uh-huh. The fire department.
Yes. They're new, but they're good.
Sir, we should get going.
Don't worry about a thing! We'll take good care of your house!
Look at me! I'm a billionaire!
Aa-aahh-ohh! Oof!.
I forgot my-
Good Lord! This bedroom is as big as our house!
And the bed never needs to be made. Check it out.
Heh-heh! 
Hmm. Seems a little wasteful.
Wasteful and. practical.
A mechanical dressing delay. Watch this, Marge.
Ooh! Ow! Oh! Ow! Oh, no! No!
Now I'm ready to hit the town.
Huh.
Uh.
Mm-hmm!
Close that door!
Aah!
Wow. He's got every Nancy Drew... even the controversial Clue in the Clock.
Tsk-tsk-tsk. So many swears.
I 'm Al Unser J r.!.
I 'm Princess Margaret!
I 'm drunk! 
It's nothing serious. Just lay off the chili, and you should be fine.
Don't you laugh, Fidel. I've been in the car with you.
Let's see. "Social Security number."
Naught-naught-naught, naught-naught, naught-naught-naught-two.
Damn Roosevelt! "Cause of parents' death." Got in my way.
Mom! Bart's making faces at me!
I think.
 Look how loud I have to yell!
This all seems a little elaborate for sloppy joes. Hmm.
I know what the other 11 forks are for, but what do you do with this one?.
 Why, Marge, I believe you're supposed to scratch your ass with it.
Homer, watch your la- Ohh!
That's a lifesaver.
Man, this is livin'.
 Stop that! Cigars are for rich people and legendary comedians...
Like Bill "Crosby" and David "Letterson."
♪  Oops, forgot to swirl it.
Homer, did you jimmy open Mr. Burns' liquor cabinet?.
"J jimmy" is such an ugly word, Marge... unless you're talking about Jimmy Smits. 
But house-sitting is a sacred- Hey!
 Stop swirling, Homer!
Listen, I worked long and hard for this place, and no one's gonna take it away from me.
Not you, not its rightful owner, not anybody.
 And another thing! If I have-
Operator, get me Thailand.
T-I- and so on.
Homer, who are you calling?.
Everybody! I found Burnsie's address book.
I called the New York Yankees and told them to bunt... and then I called the queen of England and asked her how it was going'.
And. then I-
Well, don't run up Mr. Burns' phone bill.
Just a second, Marge. Hello?. Thailand?.
How's everything on your end?. Uh-huh.
That's some language you got there. And you talk like that 24-7, huh?.
Hey!
Homer, you've got to stop pretending this is your house.
You're not a billionaire.
Gee. Way to burst my bubble, Marge.
All I'm saying is don't get too comfortable. Mr. Burns will be back tomorrow.
Marge, you're right. We do have to have a party!
Party?. No! No parties!
What about par-tay?.
No par-tays, no shindigs, no keggers, no hootenannies... no mixers, no raves, no box socials.
Damn!
And I looked so good on that bike. 
Now, Doctor, I want you to test me for everything... every disease on this chart.
Fine. We'll just start by drawing some bl*od.
Well, isn't that odd?. It's like poking through meringue.
Oh, try this arm. I saw some bl*od in there the other day.
Come on. Keep blowing.
Okay. Twelve centimeters. Excellent.
I'm a big boy.
There's your problem.
♪ 
Havin' a party, Moe. I'll need four kegs of your finest imported-sounding beer.
How about Tuborg, the beer of Danish kings?.
Mmm. Danish.
00 p.m. on account of it's Sunday.
Huh?. If you can't sell beer, what are Lenny and Carl doin' here?.
Huh?. Oh, we're just watching the sun move across the sky.
When it gets to here, we can drink again.
But I need that beer now!
00 p.m.
Or you can steal a boat and sail out to international waters. Heh!
What's that, a theme park?.
No, the ocean.
Once you get I 2 miles out, there's no laws at all.
That's where they held the Tyson/Secretariat fight.
 They were so drunk!
Gentlemen, get off your knees.
Your rich Uncle Homer is throwing the wildest box social... the high seas have ever seen!
And you're invited.
Yeah!
All right!
Oh, no, you don't! I'm not gonna let you trash Mr. Burns's yacht.
Marge, you know I normally listen to you, but I gotta seize this opportunity... just in case I never become a real billionaire.
Oh, Homie. I don't care if you're a billionaire. I love you just because you're-
Hey! There's another way to get on the boat!
Whoo-hoo! 
Propellers! Spinning!
Turn! Left! Boat go there!
Don't worry, Mom. I'm sure he'll be okay.
The boat's going sideways!
 Ship's ahoy!
Well done, Mr. Lenny. Well done.
Homer, have we hit international waters yet?. Because, uh, things are gettin' real ugly.
I can't sell you beer till we cross the line!
Legally, you could give us free beer.
Ow!
Well, could you at least give us rubbing alcohol for our wounds?.
Hey! 
Sucker! Ow!
We made it, son.
International waters- the land that law forgot.
;Ha, toro!
Wow! You can do anything out here.
That's right. See that ship over there?.
They're rebroadcasting major league baseball with implied oral consent... not express written consent, or so the legend goes.
Arr, I now pronounce ya man and cow.
Please accept these illegal fireworks with my blessing. Yarr!
There are no laws! We can do anything we want!
Anything! Ow! Ow!
Oh, real mature, Lenny!
Well, Doc, I think I did pretty well on my tests.
You may shake my hand if you like.
Well, under the circumstances, I'd rather not.
Eh?.
Mr. Burns, I'm afraid you are the sickest man in the United States. You have everything.
You mean, I have pneumonia?.
Yes.
Juvenile diabetes?.
Yes.
Hysterical pregnancy?.
Uh, a little bit, yes.
You also have several diseases that have just been discovered- in you.
I see. You're sure you just haven't made thousands of mistakes?.
Uh, no. No, I'm afraid not.
Well, this sounds like bad news.
Well, you'd think so, but all of your diseases are in perfect balance.
Uh, if you have a moment, I can explain.
Well-
Here is the door to your body. You see?. And these are oversized novelty germs.
Uh, that's influenza, that's bronchitis... and this cute little cuddle-bug is pancreatic cancer. 
Here's what happens when they all try to get through the door at once.
 Move it, chowder head!
We call it Three Stooges syndrome.
So what you're saying is I'm indestructible.
Oh, no, no. In fact, even a slight breeze could-
Indestructible.
Why are we cleaning this room?. I don't think we were even in here.
Honey, we want Mr. Burns to find this place exactly the way he left it.

Thrust! Parry! Stab, stab, stab, stab!  Oh, he ain't pretty no more.
Hey, Coast Guard! Try and stop us now, you lousy Americans.
 We can't hear you! Come 300 feet closer!
Nice try. You're not gonna nail us.
But we just want to party.
Oh, really?. Then play some rock music.

Are you friendly pirates?.
Uh, not really, no.
Then what have you done with my party guests?.
They got my bus pass! They got my bus pass!
Whoa! They're poking every nook and cranny- well, every cranny anyway.
So far, the nook is relatively-  Oh, no! No, it isn't!
Set a course for Hidden Pirate Island... a.k.a. Hong Kong.
Aye, aye, Captain.
Help! Pirates!
Navy SEALs are on the way.

Oh, we're gonna die, and I never tasted cantaloupe!
Eh, you didn't miss much. Honeydew is the money melon.
And now we will cut you loose.
For liability purposes, it is the ocean that will k*ll you, not us.
Hey, what do you know?. It floats.
That was my plan all along. Now relax, and the currents will take us home.

I prefer not to know. Frankly, one is too many.
Echh! The foul stench of youth!
Well, let's see.

Priceless coins not used in vending machine. Yes, not bad!
Mr.Burns Pirates caught your Yacht.

What have they done to your beautiful face?.
Ohh, there, there.
Smithers, this monkey is going to need most of your skin.
Ahh, it's good to be home.
I don't know. After living like a billionaire, this place is kind of a dump.
Nah, it's not so bad. Here we can spit on the floor.
Bart, stop that!
Now, we may not have antique furniture or priceless artwork... but we have everything we need right here.
That's right Just because we're not rich doesn't mean that we don't have-
