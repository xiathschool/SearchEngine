Everybody hates me.
Sir, your personal chef is here with your breakfast.
Voilà.
One raisin,     wrinkles ironed and smoothed, with one molecule of sugar.
Too sharp.
It could cut me to ribbons.
Release the hounds.
No, you need a wine pairing.
Cabernet, to bring out my earthiness.
Cordon bleu!
Smithers, I need real food.
Something that'll stick to my rib.
What is that delicious smell?
Um, uh, this is my lunch.
My wife just gave me a salad, but she said I could choose my own dressing, so I picked this hamburger.
Hmm.
Seems to be some sort of meat with a slice of James Lewis Kraft's confectionary cheese on top and a kind of catsup blended with a well-naised egg in the style of Mayon.
♪ ♪     I'll never let go.
I must have more of these, uh...
What do you call them?
Hamburgers.
You're eating people from Hamburg?
I don't know.
Maybe.
Mmm.
Sir, uh, we need to be cautious about this.
It's not healthy for a man to double his weight within a day.
Triple!
No...!
My heart!
This could be my last moment on Earth.
If so, fire someone and let me watch.
Someone who just bought a house.
Smithers.
Oh, thank God you're alive.
And famished.
Do they serve burgers in this joint?
No, sir.
Eating meat could k*ll you.
Eh, no one lives forever.
Except Dick Cheney.
What's his deal?
Sir, you nearly died.
I nearly died?
How was the reaction?
Well, when they heard you were dying...
He's alive.
Aw.
- 
- People don't like me.
They really don't.
Why?
You've released the hounds on nearly everyone in town, sir.
Everyone loves dogs, Smithers.
It must be something else.
Um, if you're ready, come.
- The cue will be "life." - Hmm.
_     Smithers, this means that no one will mourn me when I'm gone.
My only legacy will be the extra radiation on every drop of water on Earth.
- Don't give up, sir.
- No, I give up.
Don't give up.
- I give up.
- Don't give up.
I give up.
- Don't give up.
- Seriously, I give up.
Will you listen to me for one minute?
Sir, I figured out a way to add to your legacy and extend your life.
The professor here has used exotic plants to develop what I think is the healthiest, tastiest meatless burger ever.
You could eat as many as you want and we can sell them at a profit.
- Aw.
- Not here.
Not here, please.
I've told you about this.
Oh, do you know how Edison felt on that incredible, magical night?
When he invented the light bulb?
No.
The electric chair.
That's how I feel now.
Smithers, this could change my legacy.
People have to like the person who made them live longer.
They have to.
What are you saying, sir?
beloved after death.
Look at me, world.
We'll do a sneak preview of your burger chain and then a grand opening of a thousand stores across the country.
Now all we need is a name.
Excellent.
You've done it again, sir.
We're here to cover the sneak preview of our new sponsor, X-Cell-Ent Burger.
I...
I'm just getting word Springfield Dam has ruptured and water is roaring down.
We'll let the, uh, sad news cover that.
I'm here live at...
Aah!
He was a good reporter, great parking spot.
Uh, but let's move on from grief to beef.
The first paying customer to taste the X-Cell-Ent Burger will be...
Number   .

Good luck pleasing me.

I drew this picture of you hugging me, Mummy.
I don't like art that lies.
Oh, and by the way, your father's dead.
There's just one more thing we need.
A spokesman.
If we find a regular slob who loves it, we can start a chain reaction.
Just like, uh, ooh...
Nuclear fission?
Is that how that works?
Really?
Heh.
Now to find our slob.
My card.
Smithers, keep your nods to yourself.
Yes, sir.
Since we're using a green screen, do I have to be this high up?
- We need the chance of death.

Every one of those has two meanings.
Your ad guys are geniuses.
If I could be a fly on the wall...
Uh-oh.

The fate of the world is in your mouth.  
With all these commercials, I'm afraid your father's going to need bigger pants.
Alexa, do you have any X-X-X-X- X-X-X-XL in stock?
I found XLN stock.    
How much would you like to buy?  
Um, I-I don't know.
How's ten pairs?
Submitting order for a thousand shares of XLN stock.    
Please confirm.

Oh, no.
Maggie.
I accidentally bought X-Cell-Ent Burger stock.
Alexa, sell those stocks.
Ordering yellow socks.    
You get everything wrong.
We'll switch to Siri.
Siri enabled.     
You sound like Alexa.
Oh.
X-Cell-Ent Burger.
Well, they seem to be succeeding.
But I'd feel awful if the stock went...
Up?
It just went up.
We made money!
Seven hundred dollars!
What I could buy with that money.
Now it's down.
Down $   .
Up again.
Down again.
The grand opening's in a week, sir, and the reviews couldn't be better.

Smithers, I'm a hero.
Like that guy who landed the plane safely.
Sully Sullenberger?
No, no, no, no.
Rudolf Hess.
Smithers, a toast.
On it, sir.
I think you've had enough, sir.
Yes.
Yes.
I'll...
I'll sleep it off.
If it goes up another ten cents, we're a thousand dollars ahead.
We've never been a thousand dollars ahead.
Never.

How could a ploy this cynical and shameless fail?
Mel, you're three of those letters.
Where did I go wrong?

Those were set to private.
Right.
"Private."

What are you saying?
All this time I've been eating meat?!

This is kind of scary, like putting on a wet bathing suit.
Wait a minute.
Those plants look unusual.
They're all endangered plants from the Amazon rainforest.
We have to tell Burns.
He already knows.
He's evil.
No.
I refuse to believe that someone can't change for the better, even though I can't think of a single example of that ever happening.

- Yes, children.
What do you want?
Um, we came to tell you something that's maybe a little hard to hear.

I'm sorry to have to inform you that your attempt to do good is doing very, very bad.
Leave me alone.
Oh, for God's sake.
- Finally.
- Mr. Burns.
Release the hounds.
You mean these hounds?
Let's be clear, young lady.
I'm not going to listen to you.
I'm never going to listen to you, and I have sophisticated technology to ensure that happens.
Buy, buy, buy! Then, when you hear a rumor of trouble, sell before anyone else!
