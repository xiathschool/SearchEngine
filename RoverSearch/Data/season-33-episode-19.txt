title: Girls Just Shauna Have Fun


  
♪ Mary's rolling in her grave ♪  
♪ I'd like to join her now. ♪  
  
I come bearing an important communiqué.  
It's from the marching band
director at Springfield High.  
Oh, did he get his swollen
head stuck in a French horn?  
Uh, there's no mention of that.  
But it seems one of the band's
most important musicians   
injured his middle toe doing
a high step in double-time.   
- 
- That's footwork su1c1de!   
They need a replacement sax player,   
and they've requested... Lisa Simpson.   
Me, in the high school band?   
Yes, yes, a thousand times yes!   
One yes would suffice.
Pack your sax, Lisa,   
you're moving up to high school.   
Three days a week after school,   
otherwise you're still in second grade.   
I finally get to play with people   
who respect music theory and tradition.   
Teenagers!   
Class, we have a new
baritone sax player.   
Direct from Springfield Elementary.   
Largo's losers.   
Hi. Hello.   
Now, if you'll turn to page      
in your marching band songbook.   
The theme to Hawaii Five-O?! Wow!   
Yeah, Mr. Orlando is cool.   
We do   -year-old songs
instead of    -year-old songs.   
   
Shauna Chalmers,
thank you for joining us.   
I'm gonna call you James Corden,   
because you're a late, late show.   
   
He totally relates to us on our level.   
Mm.   
- Burnout.
- Waste case.   
Third-chair slacker.   
Shut up, woodwinds.   
Okay, from the top.   
   
Okay, cut.   
Apparently Supertramp
isn't giving us the rights   
to "Goodbye Stranger."   
   
No...   
Shauna! I didn't know you played drums.   
And I didn't know some tiny
band dork was gonna talk to me.   
It's me, Lisa Simpson?   
You babysat for us.   
Last Saturday night.   
TikTok is dumb.   
Well, anyway,
your drumming's really good.   
Wow.   
Dear diary, today I got a compliment   
from a rando about something
I don't care about.   
 I have a diary, too!   
 Oh.   
   
People were playing eighth
notes like it was nothing.   
Band kids are the coolest
kids in high school.   
No fair. Lisa gets to go to high school?   
I was supposed to be
King of the Burnouts   
before she even got there.   
Well, son, I guess
Lisa's just unusually bright.   
She gets it from me.    
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!   
I left all my sheet music at school.   
I have to go get it.   
Ah...   
Hmm?   
   
- Shauna!
- I'm Shauna!   
Did you stay late to practice?   
No way. As if.   
You're practicing. Being stupid.   
You don't need to. You're great at it.   
I'm jealous.   
Shauna, we share a passion for music.   
 Do you want to jam?   
Yeah, jam this stick in my eye   
if this conversation
goes on another second.   
Gah.   
Fine! But I'm not afraid
to admit that music   
means something to me, unlike you.   
You're Shauna.   
Hey!   
I'm sorry if I was mean back there...   
little weirdo.   
I really don't know how to take that.   
Well, maybe we can talk about
it tomorrow at my house...   
when you come over to jam.   
 I'd love to!   
Where do you live?   
Okay, stalker.   
   
Oh, hello, Lisa Simpson.    
And how are you this fine evening?    
Dad, stop interrogating people,
you fascist!    
Hmm.    
Wow, you're really rude to your dad.    
Thanks. That's actually
the reason I got into drums.    
To drive him crazy.    
But then I...    
Turns out, I really like playing music.    
It takes the suck out of things.    
It does take the suck out of things.    
 I just said a light swear.    
- 
-     
Well, sounds like
you girls are having fun.    
How would you know?!    
 Yes. Well, uh,    
dinner's almost ready, dear.    
Lisa and I are eating at the mall.    
I've been hand-rolling gnocchi all day.    
Stop touching my food.    
Food-toucher.    
Look at all this science stuff.    
Are you building a Frankenstein?    
'Cause if you are, you have to tell me.    
Ah, yes.
Uh, you're here to pick up Lisa.    
She's at the mall with my,
uh, challenging daughter.    
Eh, tell me something,
Simpson, do you like beer?    
Hmm, I never thought about it.    
    
Well, I've been brewing
my own Belgian ale    
in the style of the Trappist monks.    
It's a, it's a stupid hobby really.    
 That is stupid.    
I buy my beer in a bar.    
I-I'm sure you do.    
But, uh, just take a sip.    
    
This is the most delicious drink    
I ever drank that could get me drunk.    
You made this?    
Yes, I did. If you'd like,    
I could show you how to brew it
using these simple ingredients.    
Beer has ingredients?    
- What the hell?
    
You have so much to teach me.    
    
Okay, worked there, got fired there.    
Got unfairly accused
of shoplifting there.    
Oh, shoplifted a ton of stuff there.    
Wow, you've really lived.    
In this end of the mall, sure.    
Cool!    
A selfie machine.    
    
Ooh, A Prom Before Dying.    
I read that book.
It's about two teenagers    
who fall in love despite only
having    minutes to live.    
Sounds stupid.    
Let's go see it. It's on me.    
Shauna's so great.
She's like a fun, older friend    
who's mean to me for no reason.    
But somehow I really want
to hang out with her.    
What do you call that?    
Um, she seems young for a movie    
with adult themes.    
You have to let her in.    
I'm her big sister.    
 That's it... big sister!    
Now let's go watch teenage
sickos make out, then croak...

call people who aren't us.    
Isn't that cute?    
Hmm.    
Hmm, I'm not sure
Shauna's the best influence.    
She always seems like she's so over it.    
Even when "it" is something nice.    
Yep, teens are garbage.     
Anyway, I'm off to 'Mers.

Yes, verily, but,
Homer, Trappist brewing    
is about more than
just drinking the beer.    
It's about the traditions
of the Belgian monks    
who created this divine quaff.    
    
    
See, that's what I like
about home brewing.    
You're there when it enters the world,
so full of promise.    
And you know that if you
pour your heart and hard work    
into it, it won't tell you it's pregnant

Simpson!

Wow, Shauna, you're so good!    
I've been thinking,
you should try out for lead drummer.    
They would never give that to me.    
Even if I wanted it, which I don't.    
Why won't you shut up about this?    
Mmm, these Cheetos are cheesy.    
Shauna, listen,
the last thing I'd ever do    
is imply that you care,
but I think you're a star.    
And stars are meant to shine.    
So if you won't do this for yourself,    
will you do it for me?
