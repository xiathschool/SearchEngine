title: The Springfield Files



LEONARD: Hello, I'm Leonard Nimoy. The following tale of alien encounters is true and by true I mean false. It's all lies but they're entertaining lies and in the end isn't that the real truth. The answer is no. Now the story begins on a Friday morning in a little town called Springfield...
TGIF. Guys, I'm off to Moe's.
But Homer, it's ten in the morning.
Don't worry, I have a plan. I saw this in a movie about a bus that had to speed around the city, keeping it's speed over fifty. And if it's speed dropped, it would explode. I think it was called "The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down". First, I hook this common VCR into the security camera system like so. Then I insert this old video tape of us working, on a continuous loop.
So, another Friday is upon us. What will you be doing, Smithers? Something gay no doubt.
Wh-what?
You know, light hearted, fancy free, mothers lock up your daughters, Smithers in on the town.
Ha-ha-ha, exactly, sir.
Thank god it's Wednesday.
It's Friday.
Uh-oh. Wrong pills.  Uh, little help?
Sorry, Donkey Kong. You're just not a draw anymore.  Hey, he's still got it.
Thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty quarters. This better be good.
Game over. Please deposit forty quarters.
What a rip!
Thank god it's Friday.
Hello? Hello?
Bad dog.  Bad fawn. Hmm. Shoo, shoo!
 All right! It's time for ABC's TGIF line up.
Lis, when you get a little older, you'll learn that Friday is just another day between NBC's must see Thursday and CBS's Saturday night crap-o-rama.
Another Duff, Homer?
Nah, it's Friday night, Moe. I wanna try something special.
Uh, sure, sure.  Here you go. DÃ¼ff from Sweden.
Skoal!  Wait a minute, this is Duff.
Yeah, you got me didn't you. All right, here you go. Red Tick Beer.
Mmm. Bold, refreshing, and something I can't put my finger on.
Mmm, needs more dog.
Well, it's 1am. Better go home and spend some quality time with the kids.
Just a second, Homer. You gotta take a breathalyzer test before I let you drive home.
Ah, I guess I'll walk home.
Oh, son, I'm glad to see ya. I went for the morning paper and I got lost. And...
No time for you, old man.  Please don't hurt me.
Don't be afraid.
Yahh!
Homer, it's 2am. What happened?
It was an alien, Marge. It appeared in front of me and said "Don't be afraid".
Have you been drinking?
No. Well, ten beers.
I'm telling you, I saw a creature from another planet.
Maybe you just dreamed it.
Oh, yeah? Well, when I came to, I was covered with a sticky translucent goo. Explain that.
More sausage?
Dad, according to Junior Skeptic Magazine, the chances are 175 million to one of another form of life actually coming in contact with ours.
So?
It's just that people who claim they've seen aliens are always pathetic lowlifes with boring jobs. Oh, and you, dad. Hehehe.
I am the thing from Uranus.
Oh, it's Bart. I can't believe it. I'm being mocked. By my own children. On my birthday.
It's your birthday?
Yes. Remember, it's the same day as the dog's.
Santa's Little Helper, it's your birthday? Ooh, we've gotta get you a present.  Yes, we do. Yes, we do.
We love you, boy.
Good, doggy. Good, doggy,
Lousy lovable dog.
Oh, it was awful. They set me on a cold metal table and prodded me with humiliating probes. Oh, wait, that was my physical.
Nice story, Homer, really.
The alien has a sweet heavenly voice. Like Urkel. And he appears every Friday night. Like Urkel.
Wow, your story is very compelling, Mr. Jackass. I mean, uh, Simpson. So I'll just type it up on my invisible typewriter.
You don't have to humiliate me.
I just torched a building downtown and I'm afraid I'll do it again.
Oh, yeah, right. I'll just type it up on my invisible typewriter. Fruit cake.
Look at this, Scully.  There's been another unsubstantiated UFO sighting in the heartland of America. We've got to get there right away.
Well, gee, Mulder. There's also this report of a shipment of drugs and illegal w*apon coming into New Jersey tonight.
I hardly think the FBI's concerned with matters like that.
Hello. Can I help you?
Agents Mulder and Scully. FBI.
Is this about the pen that I took from the post office? I-I swear I didn't know I put it in my purse. Then I was going to bring it back but the dog chewed it up and that just made things worse.
Actually, we're here to see your husband about his UFO encounter.
Oh, come, come in.
Mr. Simpson, look at this lineup and tell us if any of these were the aliens you saw.
No, I'm sorry.
This makes me very angry.
Now we're gonna run a few tests. This is a simple lie detector. I'll ask you a few yes or no questions and you just answer truthfully. Do you understand?
Yes.
Ow.
Wait a minute, Scully. What's the point of this test?
No point. I just thought he could stand to lose a little weight.
His jiggling is almost hypnotic.
Yes. It's like a lava lamp.
All right, Homer. We want you to recreate your every move the night you saw this alien.
Well, the evening began at the gentleman's club, where we were discussing Wittgenstein over a game of backgammon.
Mr. Simpson, it's a felony to lie to the FBI.
We were sitting in Barney's car eating packets of mustard. You happy?
You are one fine looking woman, lady. If I wasn't married, I'd go out with you like that.  I am so sorry. Whatever you do don't tell Marge. God, I love her. Hey, a penny.
So, uh, who are you guys, anyhow?
Agents Mulder and Scully. FBI.
FBI, huh? Uh, excuse me.  All right, they're onto us. Get him back to Sea World.
So I says blue M&M, red M&M. They all wind up the same color in the end.
Homer, why don't you show us where you went when you left the bar.
I was standing right here when the horrible creature emerged from the woods.
For the love of god, help me! I've been here for four days and a turtle's got all of my teeth. There he is!  Come back here, you! Slow down! I'll get you!
This is the worst assignment we've ever had.
Worse than the time we were attacked by the flesh-eating virus?
Oww! He bit me with my own teeth!
No, this is much more irritating. I've seen enough, Mulder. Let's go.
Yeah, okay. But somewhere out there something is watching us. There are alien forces acting in ways we can't perceive.  Voodoo priests of Haiti, the Tibetan numerologists of Appalachia, the unsolved mysteries of Unsolved Mysteries. The truth is out there.
Ohh. Who thought a whale could be so heavy.  Geez, it's the feds!
Oh, Marge, I've never felt so alone. No one believes me. Ah, this is the part where you're supposed to say "I believe you, Homer".
I don't believe you, Homer.
You do? Oh, Marge, you've made me so happy.
You're not listening. You're only hearing what you wanna hear.
Thanks, I'd love an omelet right about now.
Homer, please. I tried to be supportive but this has gone too far. Please, just let it be.
No, I can't. This is my cause. I'm like the man who single handedly built the rocket and went to the moon. What was his name? Apollo Creed?
Please, let's just go to sleep.
No, I refuse to share a bed with someone who thinks I'm crazy. Unless you're feeling amorous?
No, I'm not.
Well, then good night.
Hey, dad. What's the word on Planet Crackpot?
Oh, I supposed you're gonna mock me too.
Well, actually, dad, I believe you.
You do?
Yes, I do. You seem so damn sure.
Thanks, son. And do you think you can stop the casual swearing?
Hell, yes.
That's my boy. So if you believe me, then I'm not going to give up. I'll prove I'm right. This Friday we're going back to the woods and we're going to find that alien.
What if we don't?
We'll fake it and sell it to the Fox network.
They'll buy anything.
Now, son, they do a lot of quality programming too.  I k*ll me.
Bud...
Weis...
Er.
Bud
Weis...
Er.
Coors.
So, dad, can I have a sip of your beer?
Now, son, you don't want to drink beer. That's with daddy's and kids with fake IDs. Besides, it's such a beautiful night, how about a ghost story.
And that is how much college will cost for Maggie.
No, no, noooo!
You know, dad, it doesn't matter that we didn't see the alien. I really had a great time out here.
Me too.  It's him!
I bring you peace.
As a representative of planet earth, let me be the first to say...  D'oh! It's gone. And we still don't have any proof.
Oh, yes, we do. I got it all on tape.
Good work, son. We did it! We did it!
And so from this simple man came the truth that we are not alone in the universe. I'm Leonard Nimoy. Good night.
Uh, Mr. Nimoy, we have ten minutes left.
Oh, fine. Let me just get something out of my car.
I don't think he's coming back.
Tonight on Eyewitness News. A man who's been in a coma for twenty-three years wakes up.
Does Sonny and Cher still have that stupid show?
No, she won an Oscar and he's a congressman.
Good night.
But first, E.T. phone Homer... Simpson that is.
Marge, kids, they're about to show my videotape.
Local man, Homer Simpson, shown here with his tongue stuck to a lamp post, has given us this video tape. It's a close encounter of the blurred kind.  Very unprofessional, Phil.
Well, Lis, what do you think about the alien now?
I think there must be a more logical explanation. And I think the people of this town aren't gonna be won over by three seconds of video tape.
Uh, I'm happy to answer any questions you have about the alien. Any questions at all. Dr. Hibbert?
Yes, is the alien carbon-based or silicone-based?
Uh, the second one. Zillifone. Next question.
Is the alien Santa Claus?
Uh, yes.
Were you on my roof last night stealing my weather vane?
This interview is over.
I remember another gentle visitor from the heavens. He came in peace and then died. Only to come back to life. And his name was E.T. the Extraterrestrial.  I love that little guy.
Leonard Nimoy, what are you doing here?
Wherever there is mystery and the unexplained, cosmic forces shall draw me near.
Uh-huh.
Hey, Spock. What do you want on your hotdog?
Surprise me.
Take a look at these t-shirts, Lisa. You don't see any "Homer is a dope" t-shirts. Do you?
We sold those out in five minutes.
D'oh!  Marge, how could you?
These t-shirts are 100% cotton. And look at the fine stitching on "dope".
I'll take two.  Look, there it is!
Oh, Homie. Homie, I'm so sorry I doubted you.
I bring you love.
Is that the love between a man and a woman, or the love of a man for a fine Cuban cigar?
Uh... I bring you love.
It's bringing love! Don't let it get away!
Break its legs!
Wait! You want an alien? This is your alien!
Hello, children. I bring you love.
Aah! It's a monster! k*ll it! k*ll it!
It's not a monster, it's Mr. Burns.
Aww, it's Mr. Burns. k*ll it! k*ll it!
No, let me explain. Every Friday evening after work, Mr. Burns undergoes a series of medical treatments designed to cheat death for another week. First, Mr. Burns' chiropractors perform a slight spinal adjustment. Then a team of doctors administer his eye drops, k*ll, and a vocal cord scraping. The whole ideal leaves Mr. Burns twisted and disorientated.
But what's with the glowing?
Um, I'll field that question. A life time of working in a nuclear power plant has given me a healthy green glow. And left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner. And now that I'm back to normal, I don't bring you peace and love, I bring you fear, famine, pestilence and...
Time for a booster.
 Good morning, starshine. The earth says hello.
 We twinkle above us, we twinkle below.
 Well, you said you'd bring them peace and love and it looks like you did it. I'm proud of you, Homie.
Thanks, Marge.
And so concludes our tale. I'm Leonard Nimoy. Good night. And keep watching to skis. Uh, skies.
