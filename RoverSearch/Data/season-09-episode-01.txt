title: The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson


What? Uh-oh. Here comes the evening rush.
Clear out, fellas!
Oh, what a day. Good evenin', Moe.
Good mornin', Moe.
Yeah, all right. Listen up, guys.
The Springfield Police have told me that 91 % of all traffic accidents... are caused by you six guys.
I knew we could do it!
Yeah, I know. I know. But the bad news is... we gotta start havin' designated drivers.
Are you kidding me?
We'll choose the same way they pick the pope.
Everybody reach in and draw a pickled egg.
Whoever gets the black egg stays sober tonight.
Whew!
Whew!
No!
You got the black one.
Hey, everybody, I'm Peter Pants-less!
I can't take this much longer.
I gotta have a beer!
Oh, no. Oh, no. Not tonight!
Not tonight!
Are you ready to get Duffed?
Hey, it's Duffman... the guy in a costume that creates aWareness of Duff.
Duffman wants to party down with the man who sent in...
10,000 Duff labels to bring me here today.
I've got a bottomless mug of new Duff Extra Cold... for Barney Gumble!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
I can't! I'm the designated driver!
Yeah, that's swell.
Duff wholeheartedly supports the designated driver program.
Now, who wants to party?
Please! I'm trying to drive!
Hey, let's go to the girls' college!
No. The Playboy Mansion. Playboy Mansion!
Shut up! It's my car, and I say we're going to the lost city of gold.
That's just drunk talk.
Sweet, beautiful drunk talk.
Good night, Barney. Don't forget to bring back my car back tomorrow. just slide it under the door.
Yes. Tomorrow.
Face it, Homer, the car is gone.
Ohl.
Barney ain't never comin' back.
Here We are, Mr. Gumble.
Huh? Thanks for the lift!
Barney, where's my car?
All I remember about the last two months... is giving a guest lecture at Villanova.
Or maybe it was a street corner.
So you lost my car, eh? Well, that's just grand.
I oughta punch you in the nose, but I have to pick up my kids at school.
Homer, I don't want you driving around in a car you built yourself.
Marge, you can stand there finding fault, or you can knit me some seat belts.
Sorry, sorry.
Dad, you got a letter from the City of New York.
Throw it away.
Nothing good has ever come out of New York City.
'Dear motorist, Your vehicle is illegally parked in the borough of Manhattan.'
My vehicle!
'lf you do not remedy this malparkage within 72 hours... your car will be thrown into the East River at your expense.'
Oh! I don't wanna go to New York City!
Why not?
New York is a hellhole!
And you know how I feel about hellholes.
Dad, you can't judge a place you've never been to.
Yeah. That's what people do in Russia.
It's time I told you about a chapter of my life I hoped would be closed forever.
I was on my way to the Harrisburg Coat Outlet to buy an irregular coat... but it required a stopover in New York City.
All I had to do Was Walk a feWblocks from the Rort Authority Bus Terminal... to my train at Renn Station.
AnyhoW, I must'ye looked at somebody the Wrong Way... because the next thing I kneW, I Was running for my life.
And that's when the CHUDs came at me.
Oh, Homer, of course you'll have a bad impression of New York... if you only focus on the pimps and the CHUDs.
Oh, I'd love to see New York.
We could all go with the bus company's special super-sitter fare.
Nine bucks? This one's on me!
Great! We're all going to New York!
Lousy Bart and his money. All right, New York, I'm comin' back!
But you're not gettin' this!
Dad, our baby pictures were in there.
Don't you start!
Wake up, eyeryone. We're almost there.
That took too long. How come we had to transfer in Atlanta twice?
I just think we should've paid the extra $1 .50 and gotten a bus with restrooms.
Hey. Marge, I can't feel my legs.
I can't feel my legs!
Homer!
Homer, those legs belong to the man behind you.
Hi.
We're here!
Wow! I feel like such a nobody.
It's wall-to-wall landmarks.
The Williamsburg Bridge. Fourth Avenue.
Governors Island.
Look!
It's ZZ Top!
You guys rock!
Eh, maybe a little.
Now remember, criminals prey on small-town folk like us.
So if anyone asks, we're sophisticated millionaires from the Ozarks.
Homer, you're scaring the children.
Good.
I don't wanna spend one extra second in this urban death maze.
You wait here at the bus station while I get the car.
The bus station is just one of the sights we came to see.
00.
Oh, all right. But not a minute later.
'Cause once the sun goes down, all the weirdos turn crazy.
I'm on to you!
'Your yehicle is illegally parked... at One World Trade Plaza.'
Hmm. Ooh!
Wow!
Governors Island looks so insignificant from up here.
Hey, immigrants, b*at it! Country's full!
Okay, folks. You heard the lady.
Back into the hold. We'll try Canada.
Stupid city!
What the hell is this thing?
Come off.
Come off.
All right, you.
Ow.
Hey, When you're done with that, I got something up here you can bite on.
Hey, why don't you be polite, you stinkin' pus bag!
Pal, you gotta call that number on the boot.
