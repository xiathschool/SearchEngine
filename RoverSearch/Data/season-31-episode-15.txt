title: Screenless


Am I the only one who remembered daylight savings time?  
Been here    years.  
Been on the HBO, the Netflix   
and one House Hunters International.   
But now I got two new hotshot lawyers working my case.   
No sign of a struggle, no DNA evidence in the cabin and no attractive young woman declared missing.   
I think there's a very real chance no one was m*rder.

I was on the jury that convicted him.   
Had we known there was no v*ctim, we might not have voted guilty.   
I repeat, might not.   
Fantastic news.   
We got picked up for a second season.   
And my appeal?   
Mostly to women    to   .   
Oh. You mean "appeal" appeal.   
Oh, well, that's not happenin.   
   
   
What is it, sweetie? Are you gassy?   
Uh, when is she not gassy?   
Baby burn.   
 If only you could talk.   
It's the people who can't speak that have so much to share.   
   
Or maybe not.   
 Wait a minute. I think there's a show about teaching a baby sign language.   
 I could finally talk to my baby.   
Maggie, we have a fun week of repetitive drills ahead.   
I wonder what the kid was so upset about.   
Don't worry, little baby.   
I'll be okay till morning.   
Now I'm screwed.   
Congratulations, babies, we've learned some great signs today.   
I hope you don't want "more," because we're "all done,"   
because our government funding "ran out."   
Okay, Maggie.   
Do you want "more" or are you "all done"?   
"More" or "all done"?

Oh, I thought they were doughnuts that were really far away.   
"More"?   
"More"? Aw, that's   .   
You busted.   
Always say "all done" on a hard   .   
Can you say that? "Hard   "?   
Don't teach her gambling.   
Let's go, dealer. One more hand.   
Aw, sir, I don't want to take your money.   
   
Remember to make sure that the warriors you k*ll   
are actually dead.   
I recommend stabbing, dissolving in acid,   
dynamite in the butt...   
Jason.
You're late for dinner!   
Ma, I'm talking to    million people!   
Boil them, let pigs eat them, Kentucky-fry them...   
Don't play that in front of Maggie.
She'll have nightmares.   
Eh, suit yourself.   
This is more like it.   
"Hansel shoved the blood-covered witch into the oven.   
'I'm burning alive,' screamed the witch."   
More? More?   
 You want more book?   
My baby's communicating with me.   
- Let me test it out. Do you like peas?

- Do you like applesauce?

- Do you like Star Wars movies?

What about Baby Yoda?   
Hmm.   
This is so exciting.
Look, look what Maggie can do.   
Maggie, do you want "more"?   
That's my girl.   
Look, everyone. She's doing it.   
Yeah, that's great.   
Dad, check this out.   
He only sings when we're not looking.    
Classic aggravation humor.

- A dancing frog.    
Bet that would cook up nice.    
You're missing a crucial moment in Maggie's development because of these.    
From now on, we're gonna limit the time we spend looking at our stupid phones.    
    
Yeah, that's great.    
And then we'll have a conversation.    
    
Steve Jobs wouldn't let his children use his iPads, and he was a great parent, I assume.    
From now on, everyone gets a half hour of screen time a week.    
- And that's it.
- Really, Marge?    
You think you can give up your Pinterest?    
My cake fails are important.    
If people fail at cake, they need to be told.    
Okay. Half an hour a week for everyone, including me.    
I believe there's something you're forgetting.    
    
And? And?    
 No more screens. You, too.    
Here at Messages, we treat your addiction humanely,

Well, let's pray this place won't be necessary.

- All right, let's round 'em up.    
Okay. It's been one week.    
Let me check your screen times.    
Wow. They're really low.    
I'm so proud of you.    
I forgot how great it was to crack the spine of a book.    
    
I'm calmer, I'm happier, I'm seeing things I never saw before.    
Did you know our second dog is a cat?    
    
Hmm?    
Sorry, last time I was here, I left my screen time reversal wrench.    
I could just get that back.    
You guys have been having this man dial back your screen time?    
Oops. Looks like I just lost a contract.    
Well, anybody want to buy a van?

Why don't you do the Daily Jumble in the paper?

Okay, Maggie, time to go.    
Say goodbye to your aunts.

Doc, this prison is great.

Since this nation was founded, families have faced the problem of staying together without driving each other crazy.    
For the first     years, they played fiddle music until they had a w*r.    
It was a good system.    
Then, they came up with sitting around a radio.    
But without a screen, they still had time to look at each other.    
So... World w*r II.    
With peace came TV, which bought Silicon Valley the time to invent the devices that isolate us completely.    
Finally, the American family was safe... from itself.    
Is any of that true?    
Once I post it on Reddit, it will be.    
Okay, we'll just say goodbye and then we'll get our things.
