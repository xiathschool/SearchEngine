What? Cheap, lousy...  
Ah, there.  
♪ ♪  
  
♪ ♪  
Springfield... the city sleeps.  
But a storm is brewing over the home of...  
♪ The Simpsons. ♪   
Interesting fact, the singers that sang that song   
are all dead.   
Enjoy the show.   
Hello, family!   
I'm    minutes away.   
Can I bring anyone a...?   
Mmm, pork chop.   
   
Flanders, you need a new mailbox!   
   
   
   
Are these from the gas station?   
Uh, Marge, please.   
They're from a supermarket that sells gas.   
Were you at Moe's?   
Yeah, celebrating St. Patrick's Day.   
Ah, the Blarney Stone, Angela's Ashes, centuries of troubles.   
It's not St. Patrick's Day.   
Well, on the real day, the price of green hats goes through the roof.   
I thought you'd be happy I was saving money.   
Cheap hats? You ruined Sunday dinner for cheap hats?!   
That's not... You know, forget it.   
- That's it?
- Yeah, that's it.   
Thanks for the flowers.   
I'm sure they were nice, but they're wilting now.   
   
Honey, when you were talking about those flowers, was it a metaphor for anything?   
Was it?   
Honey? Metaphor?   
So I thought she'd be furious, but nothing.   
She was as aloof as Steve Martin.   
   
Ahoy-hoy. This is Sector  G, where... where, uh... What does go on here?   
Mostly we decide which of us should be on the lookout for you.   
Which was supposed to be you, Lenny.   
Coo-coo-coo...   
Yes, well, this is Nigel, an old boarding school chum, and, uh, this Piccadilly Circus walkup is his wife.   
I have to go, luv.   
I've got to pick up a lip tint at the chemist's.   
Farewell, darling. You take the sun with you.   
You never told me about her.   
Well, you never told me about your handsome young man.   
Who, Smithers?    
He just works here.   
Smithers, I see you're one of those truly devoted people who make one forget   
love is an illusion.   
Eh, I'm just a man who enjoys his job.   
Uh, time for your pill, sir.   
   
   
Did you swallow the cheese and not the pill?   
Nuh-uh.   
Show me.   
   
That's a good boss.   
Such devotion.   
My wife is in love with her tennis coach,   
Rolando.   
Well, I believe in true love.   
Like the first time I saw profit.   
 A day doesn't go by that I don't think of that ledger.   
   
Hey, Homie.   
That's our cue.   
Lenny, when you say "That's our cue," then you're supposed to leave.   
Dear God, so many times I must have looked like a complete ass.   
Homer, this is the part of the marriage where the needle is on "E," but we still have a little more gas.   
The brink of doom, where I do my best work.   
And I want to break out of our rut, so I brought us a nice lunch.   
Oh, honey, you've given me a big appetite.   
For what?   
Careful, Homer, she's expecting   
a non-food answer.    
- For... you?
- Oh...    
Well, I have to admit,    
that was suggested by the nose.    
Finally, some credit.    
Mmm...    
Wait, I want to know that you're really gonna change.    
Marge, I get it. I truly get it.    
And to prove it, I'm eating a carrot.    
Oh...    
Mmm.    
Sir, do you need help with that tea bag?    
No, I can talk to Nigel by myself.    
Nigel, you were wrong about the Crimean w*r,  and you're wrong now.    
Love can endure.    
Oh, I could dissolve that union as easily as the tea dissolves this sugar.    
Smithers, did you see him heft that sugar cube?    
Did I.    
Monty, I can break up that couple, and I'd wager five million on it.    
- Dollars or pounds?
- Pounds.    
- Sterling or flesh?
- Sterling, this time.    
Oh, that money is as good as mine.    
Look at them spooning.    
    
    
    
Hmm.    
    
Excuse me there, Simpson.    
May I buy you a drink?    
Thanks, Alfred, but my marriage is in a very unusual condition... good...    
- And I want to get home.
- Now, now.    
I'm an old friend of your boss',  and if you turn me down, it will not go down favorably.    
Will it go down unfavorably?    
- Mm, it may.
-     
- Very well, then.
-     
    
No texting your wife.    
I'll just tell her I'm drinking with an English guy.    
    
What does that mean?    
He'd better just be around the corner.    
    
Oh.    
♪ ♪    
Oh!    
And everyone left the hot tub except for Ringo, Princess Margaret, and me.    
Yeah, uh, listen, Dr. Doolittle, I like hearing you talk, but I got to get home.    
So, been married long?    
Knocked her up right after high school.    
I can't listen to that story without getting weepy.    
Hey, hey, that's my talking bar rag!    
Let go of that!    
You doing all right there, Raggy?    
Yeah, that's good.    
So, Homer, the only woman you've ever been with is your wife.    
How shall I put this? You thumped one melon and left the store satisfied.    
If you knew anything about me, you would know    
I would never, ever shop in the produce section.    
Homer, have you ever thought there might have been other melons... bigger, smaller, more exciting?    
Oh, the women I could have had.    
You drew me in fifth grade, and I've never gotten over you.    
I like a man who pours me on everything.    
Oh...    
I think it's time I went home to my wife.    
    
I fear my seed landed on barren soil.    
Oh, yeah, he's crazy about that Midge.    
Eh, she's got it all. Hair that goes on forever...    
Moe, I always wondered something.    
Who are you talking about when you say "Midge"?    
Why, Marge, of course.    
What the...     
Wait'll Midge hears about this!    
Hmm, this might be worked from another angle.    
So, Moe, you find Homer's wife attractive?    
Yeah. She barely knows I exist.    
Which is the only thing I got going for me.    
Well, how would you like me to set you up in a more elegant establishment?    
More elegant than this?    
Aah!    
This may just be the bonk on the head talking, but sure.    
Oh.    
    
    
Marge, I know I'm late, but I'm really sorry.    
"Sorry" and "Congratulations, Graduate."    
They had a two-for-one sale.    
- Now, I'm late because...
- Don't bother.    
- But there's a really good...
- It's too late.    
- But you're gonna laugh when you...
- No.    
I just have to accept that you're never going to change.    
No, no, don't give up. I've changed before.    
I lost my hair and got fat.    
Good night.    
Oh, good night.

- How was your night?
- The usual.    
    
So, it's Saturday morning.    
What do you want to do today?    
- Nothing.
- Hey, Homer,    
I got an extra ticket for the ball game.    
Box seats.    
He'll take it.    
Marge, no.    
Flanders ruins baseball.

D'oh.    
Hi, hon, I'm near Moe's, but I can come right home.    
I haven't even put a coin in the meter.    
Just what I needed to hear.    
Oh... Oh, damn it.    
    
Aw, maybe now I can finish my novel.    
I just wish I hadn't left it in there.    
Yeah, well, don't worry, you still got old Moe.    
Moe  . . It's a whole new me.    
I even bought one of those new gizmos that everyone's using.    
Why'd you close the bar?    
Well, I've been set up in a high-end establishment by a well-heeled backer.    
Really, you should see the heels on this guy.    
MoHo House?    
Yes, MoHo House, the vaguely British, invitation-only club that celebrities who don't want publicity    
can be sure to be seen at.    
I'm going there now. Don't tell anyone.    
Tonight is the grand opening for the town's hottest new destination, run by the man most in demand for Springfield's haunted houses, Moe Szyslak.    
    
Oh, sorry, force of habit.    
 How you doing?    
Good to see you, Mr. Mayor.    
Bumblebee Man, ¿cómo está?    
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.    
No can do, Mr. "Movie Star."    
Your last picture...  was a b*mb.    
The trailer gave away too much, like, uh, the fact that it was terrible.    
I deserve a good time.    
I can have a good time.    
The heck with Homer.    
Thanks for the lift, Homer.    
    
    
I really don't think you're taking this seriously enough.    
    
What are you up to, Nigel?    
Oh, just stacking the deck in my favor, as sporting men are wont to do.    
A posh club, beautiful single men and women, irresistible temptations to my unsuspecting quarry.    
 Good luck breaking them apart.    
- See you.
- Hmm.    
    
I can have fun by myself.    
Would you care to spill a drink on me and use it as an excuse to meet me?    
Can I eat the cherry first?    
Don't take too long.    
I might; I asked for extra cherries.    
They don't charge for extra cherries.    
Monty, what say we make this wager something meaningful?    
Like what?    
How about my entire fortune against your boy Friday?    
    
Smithers?    
    
Oh.     
Well, I can't possibly lose. You're on.    
Mr. Burns, you can't use me as a gambling chip.    
Check your contract.    
 I'll be darned.    
It also says I'm permitted to mold your hair into whimsical shapes.    
Smithers want a cracker?    
 Got to get a better lawyer.    
Ooh, those fingers.    
    
The chimp yes, the clown no.    
Don't tell me, it's because I'm Jewish.    
No, it's 'cause you're a has-been nobody likes, all right?    
Please tell me it's because I'm Jewish.    
    
Moe, good to see you.    
Oh, good to see you, Midge.    
Boy, who knew you'd look so great in a strapless dress?    
Well, thank you.    
Methinks I see my opportunity.    
Why are you telling me?    
I always considered us friends.    
So, let... Uh, what's your name there?    
Brant... Brant here pour something for you.    
We got loads of microbrew with crazy names, like, uh, Hops-along Cassidy and Michelob.    
So, uh, where's Homer?    
We're not spending as much time together.    
Whoa, this night, when I opened up    
a fabulous new bar, just got interesting.    
    
Hey, Stogie, how about a little "Moonglow"?    
Not the real moon.    
Oh, you mean the drug.    
No, the song.    
    
"Moonglow," that's my favorite song.    
Yeah, you came into my bar seven years ago    
and you played it on the jukebox.    
I remember things like that.    
So, you want to dance?    
I actually do it a lot, but, uh, nobody sees behind the bar.    
I guess one dance couldn't hurt.    
So, can you start Monday?    
Oh, you won't break up the Simpsons.    
I'm not used to getting my arms all the way around someone.    
Oh, God, I can't work for a man I'm not in love with.    
I've got to fix this now.    
Simpson, you need to patch things up with your wife now.    
We're fine. Excuse me, bartender?    
I ordered three dozen wings and I only count   .    
Listen to me, this was gonna be a birthday present for my mother, but I want you to give it to Marge.    
Okay, what's the gag?    
You have to reconcile with your wife.    
Mm, there's always a catch.    
I've seen a whole different side of you tonight, Moe.    
Whoa, she's waving me home    
like a third-base coach.    
But could I really do that to Homer?    
Damn it, I need time to think here.    
Sorry, this is great, but I got to go stick plastic ribbons onto toothpicks.    
That don't just happen.    
If Moe can change, why can't my husband?    
Well, um, seems to me the reason your husband won't change is 'cause he knows he's got a great thing with you.    
If he suddenly treated you different, that should worry you.    
I mean, duh, I guess.    
You know? Duh?    
- Hey, Marge.
- Homie!    
I got you something.    
    
What the...?    
That's not from you.    
Can't you at least open it so I can find out what it is?    
Marge, I got the best gift I ever got you in my life.    
Huh?    
- 
- Okay, that's not great.    
And why, if you were trying to be close, would you spend the whole evening away from me?    
Hey, you've taken me off the market since I was   ,  which I immediately regret saying.    
Look, I'm on my knees.    
Why aren't you forgiving me?    
I'll follow you.    
Ow, hairbrush.    
Ow, alphabet blocks.    
Ow, dog toy!    
Wasn't even a card for me.    
    
I hope you kids haven't lost any respect for your old man.    
Uh, can't lose what you don't have.    
Thanks, boy.    
Ow! Oh!
