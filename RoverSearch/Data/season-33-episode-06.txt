title: A Serious Flanders


  
  
  
A greedy man once yearned for more,  
so the fool began to borrow.  
He ate and drank and told the bank,  
"I'll pay the debt tomorrow."  
But as both dolt and purse grew fat,  
the calendar grew thinner.   
   
The debt collector had enough   
and hungered for his dinner.   
-

The coward ran, with coin in hand,   
but come dawn, lost his breath.   
The fool was caught,   
'twas all for naught,   
for the collector's name was Death.   
 Heck of a poem there, fella.   
I just caught the tail end.   
You got any more chilling
verses in that book of yours?   
Oh, this isn't a poetry book,
cowboy-man.   
This is a ledger of debts.   
Debts to be paid in money or bl*od,   
and lately, Venmo.   
I've been sent to collect in bl*od.   
   
Don't do this!   
I have a wife and two young mistresses,   
also a secret other wife.   
Please, I'm a good man.   
A good man!   
   
In my experience, Mr. Texan...   
...there's no such thing as a good man.
