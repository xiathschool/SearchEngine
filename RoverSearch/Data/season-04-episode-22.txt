Ah, Rainier Wolfcastle... star of McBain and the upcoming film...
Help, My Son is a Nerd!
My son returns from a fancy East Coast college... and I'm horrified to find he's a nerd.
 I'm laughing already.
It's not a comedy.
Oh.
Attention! This is the Coast Guard.
A 50-foot tidal wave is heading this way.
All game shows off the beach!
Everybody up here to my square.
It's safe and it's sexy. Oh, baby.
Hurry, Charlie. There is not much time.
I ain't goin' nowhere.
I been in this square pert' near 30 seasons, and I ain't a-leavin' now.
He's dead now.
 Gabbo! Gabbo! Gabbo!
Did you see that?
Yeah.
What's Gabbo?
I figure it's some guy's name.
Some guy named Gabbo.
Hmm.
I don't think they're giving enough information, Dad.
I'll figure it out. I'm gonna use all the power of my brain.
Look, Smithers! Garbo is coming!
Uh, yes, sir.
Everyone is saying "Gabbo this" and "Gabbo that," but no one is saying "worship this" and "Jericho that."
What's this about Gabbo?
I can't believe it. Our first glimpse of Gabbo!
He'll tell us what to do.

Hello. I'm Gabbo.
And I'm Arthur Crandall.
That's easy for you to say.
You don't have a hand up your tuchas.
Oy! Hey!
 Oh, Gabbo.

I slaughtered the Special Olympics.
Are those our ratings? Let me see.
I lost to Channel Ocho? What the hell is that?
Dos huevos, por favor.

He's dead!
All right, here's the deal.
Every time you watch my show...
I will send you $40!
Checks will not be honored.
I admit I used the city treasury to fund the m*rder of my enemies.
But as Gabbo would say, "I'm a bad widdle boy."
Well, kids, this is where you would watch Itchy and Scratchy... except they're on the Gabbo Show now.

What the hell is that?
Well, that's it.
We've been canceled. I think we can be proud... that we never did a bad show... except for that week Ray Jay Johnson was my co-host.
"You can call me Ray, and you can call me Jay."
Ooh! That thing was funny for about three seconds.
The important thing is, we're like a family.
Krusty, I--
Shut your hole!
Krusty, how ya holding up?
Well, I'm kinda worried about the future.
How do you deal with it?
Well, you've been on TV longer than I have. I'm sure you've saved up quite a nest egg.
Uh, yeah.
Do they still buy human hair down at the wig shop?
Krusty, you wanna stay for dinner?
Nah, sorry.

Why, the fax machine is nothing but a waffle iron with a phone attached.
It's ringing.
 Hello. Is this Krusty the Clown?
 Is this the callback for that porno film?
Look, I was a little nervous that day... but I'm all man, I can assure you.
 No, I represent a Japanese camera company.
We'd like to pay you two million dollars to do a camera commercial.
Whoa! Me rikey velly much!
Oh, I hope I didn't offend you. I need this bad.
Bad enough to hit yourself over the head with the phone?
Oh! You got it! Ow!
Ow! Ooh, bl*od.
What the-- 
If this is anyone but Steve Allen, you're stealing my bit.
Somebody ought to ruin Gabbo's career the way he ruined Krusty's.
Two wrongs don't make a right, Bart.
Yes, they do.
No, they don't.
Yes, they do.
No, they don't. Dad!
Yes, they do.
Two wrongs make a right, Lisa.

I wish you'd stop saying that.
Hmm.
Hey, boyo, what's so funny?
Well, it's-- Ah, you wouldn't be interested. It's too lowbrow.
No, I'm quite lowbrow.
Well, somebody just wrote a bawdy limerick on the men's room wall.
This I gotta see!
All the kids in Springfield are S.O.B.s.
Gabbo's kind of language has no place on or off TV.
And that's my two cents.

But few know about the laboratory, the biosphere... the alternative energy research center.
Fascinating.
Desalinization plant?

 Hi, kids.
It's me, Gabbo!
Pork prices rose in early trading today.
But you've gotta comeback, Mel!
We're a team.
No, Krusty.
You always treated me rather shabbily.
On our last show, you poured liquid nitrogen down my pants... and cracked my buttocks with a hammer.
Ah, come on. You wanna waste your life... hanging out with a bunch of dorky teenagers?
Here's your taco, mister. Oops.
It fell in the fryer. I'll get it out. Ow! Ow!
Ow!Ow!
Sorry, Krusty. I like it here.
Mr. Johannson treats me with dignity.
Is this clown bothering you, Mel?
That's all right, Mr. Johannson. I'll handle it.
Here's your taco, sir.
I don't want it.
But this comes out of my salary. If I had a girlfriend, she'd k*ll me.
Okay, Krusty, let's rehearse the balloon bit.
Look, kids! A horsie!
And what are you making, Sideshow Luke Perry?
A I 9th-century carousel.

What've we got?
Ray Jay Johnson.
Oy. Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!
Now, boys... the network has a problem with some of your lyrics.
Would you mind changing 'em for the show?
For get you, clown.
Hey, our lyrics are like our children, man. No way.
Well, okay. But here, where you say...
"What I got, you gotta get and put it in you," how about just, "What I'd like is I'd like to hug and kiss you"?
Wow! That's much better.
Everyone can enjoy that.
