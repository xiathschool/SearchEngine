Mmm.   
Mmm.   
I downloaded you a podcast about beers   
that you don't hear much about anymore.   
Ooh, there's a whole
episode about Löwenbräu.   
If no one minds,
I brought a few beverages   
to lubricate the evening.   
- Me, too.

So what the hell are we waiting for?   
Let's dial up the Netflix.

The writing on this show is amazing.   
Oh-ho. Men can have muscles

The ad in the beer podcast

Honey, what's wrong?   
You look like what I see in

Also, a strange blender

 I think I drank just   
a toonsie-teensy bit too much

Marge, you need to take
a long look at yourself.   
We can't be a two-hangover household.
We just can't.   
I'm sorry, sweetie,
but I just don't think   
I can go to church this morning.   
Oh, my... Aw...   
No church? Oh, no.   
Well, I guess
I'll have to find another way

Mmm, chest chips.   
I meant you'll have to

Now I'd like to invite
our littlest angels   
to head to Sunday school
with Mrs. Lovejoy.   
   
Try spending a weekend with
her in the Wisconsin Dells.   
This week's Junior Jesus Jamboree topic   
is "Honor Thy Mother and Father."    
- Who would like to go first?
- Oh! Oh!    
Sunday school presentations
don't affect my grades    
and won't help me get into college,    
and I'm not even a practicing Christian,    
but I still have a sick need to excel,    
so pick me! Pick me! Pick me!    
I think we'll start with... Hmm.    
    
    
Bart Simpson. Oh, but I'm guessing    
you forgot all about your presentation.
    
You know, Helen, for a woman of faith,    
you have so little of it in me.    
For this assignment, I was born ready.    
    
 Well,    
it's not hard to honor my mother.    
Marge is a class act all the way.    
As for my father, well, with a dad    
like Homer Simpson,
how could I not honor him?    
    
    
He's so hardworking and dignified.    
Mmm.    
- 
-     
    
    
And he carries himself with
such class and panache.    
Mascot, oh, goes for the kiss    
and, oh, he goes into the
proposal with the bouquet.    
Tosses it away and he
faints out of love,    
and the big, fat guy
is having none of it    
and he's giving chase.    
- The fat guy is on the field.
- HOMER: Come here, you.    
And the Freak is running away,    
and he's using the players as obstacles.    
And now he's smashing his...

As you can see, wherever my dad goes,    
people cheer.    
Look, if you didn't want me

In conclusion, I honor my father    
because he is not not not not a loser.    
One, two, three, four.    
That's an even number of nots.    
He thinks I'm a loser.    
How dare you show your peers

- Haw-haw-haw!

- Huh?
-     
I hate the Welsh,
but I hate you even more!    
    
My son has no respect for me.
He shamed me    
in front of the whole Sunday school.    
Even Ralph. What about all the videos    
of me not being a loser?
Where were they?    
Oh, boy. It's so sad    
that kids just use cameras for shaming.    
We've raised a generation
that only loves fails.    
My fails.    
    
At least I have a lady to rub my face.    
Bart's gonna spend the rest
of his life lotioning himself.    
Maybe Bart doesn't understand    
how hard you work to
provide for this family.    
When I was a girl,    
my father took me to
work with him one day.    
I felt so proud when I
saw him playing pizza    
in that antacid commercial.    
 That's what I should do.    
Take Bart to work.    
Then he'll be proud of me.    
Pizza proud.    
Mmm.    
Seven, eight and nine.    
Oh!    
- 
- Watch me work    
and be proud, you jerk.    
- 
- No.    
I don't want to hear your friends    
tell me how big I've gotten.    
Hmm.     
Oh. Well-played, big man.    
Larry! Slap a guest badge on him!    
Larry!    
And this thing over here is
if the core gets too hot.    
I'm all over that.    
And this dealie over
here is if the core...    
goes missing.    
Has that ever happened?    
Not on my watch.
And the way you can be sure    
is that everyone you know isn't dead.    
- Hmm.
- Hey, Homer.    
Monday morning doughnuts are here.    
- 
-     
Take your pick.    
Chocolate frosted? Maple bar?    
Better hurry or you're gonna get plain.    
Doughnuts. Do you have to pay for 'em?    
Sure, technically.     
It's an honor system.    
    
Whoa. A pop machine full of free pop.    
A TV showing that jerk Dr. Phil.    
A poster on how to choke a guy.    
I think that's for after you choke him.    
- 
- Simpson,    
I need that updated spreadsheet    
on the hard water degradation rate.    
Watch this.    
I told you interns    
to spread-date the graduation
on the hard lemonade.    
So find out what I'm talking about    
- and get it done!
- Yes, Mr. Simpson.    
_    
And you get free markers?
When I get back to school,    
I'm gonna go Sistine Chapel
on those toilet stalls.    
Why wait?    
Here you go, Simpson.    
- Best part of the job.
-     
You know it, Linda.    
Dad, is that your paycheck?    
Sure is.    
- Can I see it?
- I'll do you one better.

Give it to me in singles.    
Minus the  . % check-cashing fee.    
I didn't ask for your life story.    
And here's what makes it all worthwhile.    
Whoa. You get all that every week?    
Every two weeks.    
    
Ah, the laugh of respect.    
Oh, my God, is it picture day?    
Lisa, quick, let me fix your hair.    
Ow! It's not picture day,    
and my hair's not pasta.    
I am dressed this way to honor Dad.    
I never thought about it,
but Homer makes enough    
to pay for this awesome crib, two cars,    
with enough left over
to fill the freezer    
   
waffle, curly and steak-cut.    
Dad, all these years    
I thought you were just
some uncool roommate    
that I got stuck with.    
Now I realize you're a winner.    
And that's why I want to be
a nuclear safety inspector.    
    
Marge, he doesn't just respect me.    
He wants to be me.    
What a feeling.    
Oh... this must be
how LeBron feels about...    
...Bronny.    
Mmm.    
Just like you, Dad, I can't wait    
to live the American dream.    
Well, actually...    
- What?
- Oh, nothing.    
Pew, pew, pew!    
I'm a superstar spaceman.    
I'm a modern superhero. I can fly,    
but I can't process my own trauma.    
I'm a nuclear safety guy.    
I get tons of money for
not blowing the town up.    
Well, the thing about that is...    
- What?
- Nothing.    
- Forget I said anything.
-     
Hey, Dad, guess what.    
I made a homemade ID badge,
and Larry just waved me in.    
Huh. Where is he?    
    
Oh, man, what a gig.    
Homer's got it made.    
He sure does.    
So, you're visiting your
old man at work today?    
I sure am. And this sweet job    
will be mine someday.    
- Wha...?
- Hate to burst your bubble, kid,    
but the kind of job your dad has    
- just doesn't exist anymore.
- Why not?    
Well, there's no simple answer to that.    
- All right. See you later.
