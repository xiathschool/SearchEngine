title: Pixelated and Afraid


What should we do now?
We've captured the cad  
who poisoned all those copper barons,
and it's barely  :  .  
reservation right here.  
Why, this is the restaurant
where you proposed.  
Oh, you did remember our anniversary.  
Well, look who else remembered.  
Aster.  
And he's carrying the
Sapphire of Ceylon.  
Oh, Mick, you think of everything.   
- Ooh.
- Mmm.   
- Aster!
- Oh, let him go.   
He can wear it with the diamond
brooch he buried last week.   
- Well, I'll drink to that.
- Darling,   
you drink to everything.   
Mmm.   
Oh, when I get married,   
I hope I have the breezy
elegance of Mick and Moira.   
Oh, I'm sure you'll have
what your father and I have.   
Yep, ten years,
but we still got that magic.   
   
Thanks, sweetie.   
Mmm. Ooh, change the channel.   
Love It or Lift It is on.   
They're going to unwrap
Steven's new face tonight.   
Ew, it's covered in Dad cheese.   
I'm going to bed.
I'll leave you to your magic.   
- 
-    
Ew.   
   
Bart, I'm worried about Mom and Dad.   
   
The mushroom spores are replicating.   
Torch the fungus.   
   
Lis, I'm holding the a*mo
for the whole team.   
Bart, I need a reload.   
- 
- Ow! Why do I feel that?   
Mom and Dad have completely given up.   
Their relationship has
no spark or romance.   
You got me out of my
game for girl words?   
They're nothing like
the couples in movies   
or prescription drug commercials.   
They don't dance on
beaches or hang glide,   
They just watch TV and
DustBust burp dust.   
I don't know,
this sounds like another Lisa thing   
- that's not actually a thing.
- Come with me.   
What are our lovely parents
up to this fine Sunday?   
Champagne brunch? Historic walking tour?   
Or is Mom crawling around
on homemade kneepads?   
Good news. The only ants
I'm finding are already dead.   
Leave the corpses.   
It'll send a message to the colony.   
You might be wondering, "Why does Dad   
have a trash can bungeed to his waist?"   
to catch his taco droppings.   
   
Homer,
if there's room in your taco trough,   
I've got a present from Maggie.   
Hip hop.   
- Up top.
-    
   
Nice throw.   
 Nice catch.   
   
Okay, it's disturbing, but that's why,   
  
- "don't look, don't care."
- You should care.   
You're gonna live with these
two well into your adult years.   
Do you want your future
dates to be greeted   
by Captain and Mrs. Underpants?   
Hey, baby, you look great.   
- We got to go.
- HOMER : Bart,   
introduce us.   
We want to see her.   
I hope you have what we have someday.   
Couch love. Couch love.
-    
We got to do an intervention.   
Mom, Dad, we need to talk.   
Not during    Days in a Swamp.   
They're about to reveal who
they found inside the alligator.   
Cody, Cody, Cody, Cody.   
First of all, this is a safe space.   
We love you.   
But no child should have to see
their parent wear a wastebasket.   
- It's...
- All you loads do is sit on the couch and watch crappy TV.   
We watch educational shows
that teach real-world k*ll,   
like hauling crab out of the Bering Sea.   
Do you kids know how to pull a gaff hook   
out of a crabber's forearm?   
They know nothing of the sort, Marge.   
You've gotten into a rut.
Look at this room.   
Two people, and yet there's,
like, six throw blankets.   
There's nine.
Each one serves a vital purpose.   
And I think it's sweet   
that we're so at ease with one another.   
There's so much you're missing out on.   
Entertaining, travel, standing upright.   
You won the school raffle   
for a week at The Saffron
Togetherness Center.    
But this voucher has sat
on the fridge for a year.    
Ugh, that thing. We were hoping
to win the kettle corn kettle.    
But this place sounds perfect.    
A tranquil setting that
blissifies coupleosity    
by removing the distractions of
technology and entertainment.    
The Saffron Center sounds so romantic.    
It's at the top of Honeymoon Mountain.    
Unless you saggy-bottomed couch monsters    
have given up on romance.    
What? I love romance.    
Romance is like my oxygen. But
your mom doesn't want to go.    
Oh. Do you want to go?    
Of course I do.    
Unless you're not into romance,
no judgment.    
I love romance.    
- So, we're going.
- Great.    
- Great.
- Great.    
- It is great.
- Yep.    
So great.    
Hmm, no phones or
television for the whole week,    
and the menu is keto-based.    
Are you trying to pronounce
"Cheeto-based"?    
- No.
-     
Deep down, I knew you probably weren't.    
There's a group meditation
on Saturday with Sharice.    
- What time's it start?
- Sunrise.    
We won't be seeing Sharice.    
There's silent sweat lodge yoga.    
Oh, that's also at sunrise.    
Hmm, "sunrise," "sunrise," "sunrise."    
 Ooh, there's a sunset hike.    
Nope, that starts at sunrise.    
Hmm.    
- This place sucks.
- Sucks so hard.    
I only wanted to go because you did.    
I never want to go anywhere!    
Then turn around, baby.    
- We're going home.
- Already turning.    
- 
- Homer!    
- Turn into the skid.
- I am!    
Th-Then turn out of the skid.    
 What does the skid want?    
    
    
- Uh, are you okay?
-     
Yes. Yes, I-I think so.    
    
D'oh!    
- 
-  Rocks!    
We have to jump now!    
Homer!    
    
Okay, I can pound that dent out.    
    
I'll call AAA.    
This seems like a good time to join.    
Okay, no phone, no car.    
But we made it out of
the water and we're safe.    
Homer, listen to me.    
We are not safe.
We are in a dire situation.    
We're soaking wet and it's very cold.    
We have to fix that now.    
We have to make a fire.    
On our survival shows,
they all use a bow drill.    
- Find a sapling.
- Or we could do this.    
    
That's amazing!    
Where did you learn that?    
Remember all those recall
letters that said our phone    
- would swell up and explode?
- But you exchanged that phone.    
Nope. I said I did.    
Okay, fine, fine. But we have a fire.    
Now get those wet clothes off.    
In front of the fauna?    
Just do it!    
Almost dry.    
figure out the way back to the road.    
Help me up that tree.    
- 
- No...    
- No, Homer, no.
- I got you.    
- Where'd you go?
- Not that way.    
- Up or down?
- I'm not up!    
- Can't breathe!
- Turn me around.    
    
And watch my thingy!    
    
    
Ooch. Ooh. Rough bark.    
Homer, don't look up.    
Ow! Ow...    
    
Dang, my thingy again.    
Okay, if you see more than one road,    
we should walk to the one
with a sit-down restaurant,    
because I could really go for a booth.    
Oh, no.    
All I see are trees.    
Nothing but trees.    
So... we're lost?    
 Wait! I see something!    
Something bright red!    
And it's close by!    
Ooh. Ow.    
    
- What'd you see? What is it?
- I don't know.    
But it looks man-made.    
And right now, it's our only hope.    
Are the clothes dry?    
Almost dry.    
No, no, no!    
This is worse than Nude
and Screwed season six    
when Jerry got airlifted out    
because howler monkeys
bit his pixilated area!    
Homie, I know this looks bad.    
We don't have clothes or fire    
or shelter or food or hope of rescue    
- or...
- I know what we don't have!    
But we have the red thing!    
And it's all we have!    
Now, run!    
    
Maybe it's a fire truck.    
Ow! Or a double-decker bus.    
Owie! Or a Twizzler factory.    
Ow! Ooh, that went in me.    
A bathtub?    
A sexy bathtub?    
Hmm.    
    
"Since     ,    
"Honeymoon Mountain has been a
mecca of matrimonial merriment    
where newlyweds do that voodoo
you do after saying 'I do.'"    
 A cigarette machine!    
Yes! A matchbook!    
We have something to
jot phone numbers on!    
- Oh... ah...
- Oh... ah...    
Oh, I can feel my front stuff again.    
We can turn these abandoned
snuggle shacks into shelter.    
And warm clothes.    
What the heck is that?    
I think it's a champagne glass Jacuzzi.    
We might just be saved.

It might be the melting
fiberglass talking,    
but I think we'll be okay
until they come and rescue us.    
Oh, my God. No one will know    
we never made it to the Saffron Center    
because of their stupid no-phone policy.    
 I hope their
rooftop tantric pavilion    
falls into their Zen meditation garden.    
No one's looking for us.    
They don't even know we're missing.    
Well, on Helicopter Hiker Hunters,    
"If you're lost, stay put,    
at least until the snow melts."    
That could be tomorrow
or a month from now.    
Oh, we've just got to survive here    
until they notice we're gone.    
Luckily, we have a warm shelter,
water...    
And love.    
That's sweet.    
No, that's the name
of this old massage oil.    
Hmm...    
Tomorrow we'll find food.    
I'll throw another TV on the fire.    
    
    
Oh, no berries, no nuts,
our traps are all empty...    
Oh, I thought I knew what hunger was,    
but now I know that was
just not being full.    
Last week there was Cheerios
powder at the bottom of the bag,    
and I just threw it out.    
That powder sounds so good.    
Tell me about the powder again...    
slowly.    
    
Don't just complain... offer solutions!    
    
Oh, great,
now they're talking to each other.    
- This has to work.
- Yeah.    
Fish are way stupider
than rabbits or nuts.    
You stupid fish!    
Why don't you bite my bait-less hook?!    
Oh, be careful.    
You'll get your shag pants wet.    
I didn't used to wear carpeting!    
I used to wear pants!    
Made out of pants! Oh!    
Homer!    
Homer!
Homer, get out of those wet clothes    
and get to the fire.    
 Grab it! Grab it!    
Don't let it get away!    
Oh! I've got fishnet stockings.    
Oh, no! They're crotchless!    
Get him! Get him!    
Get him! Oh! Oh, no!    
Don't let it go!    
    
    
We got it!    
Oh, thank you!    
Thank you, you beautiful fish,
thank you.    
 Group hug!    
    
Oh, oh,
this is the best meal of my life.    
Mmm...    
Oh, God. This is what I want
to eat for every birthday now.    
Mmm.    
Ah...    
We're gonna be okay.    
It's amazing how the
world seems brighter    
with a little food in your belly.    
 Yeah, you got that right.    
- I miss the kids!
- Oh.    
What if we never see them again?    
Oh, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey.    
We're gonna get back home,    
and you're gonna smother
them with so much love,    
they'll never become functioning adults.    
You promise?    
I promise.

Don't worry, don't worry.

predator out there.    
Oh. Good thing we're in here.

Oh, my God, a wolverine!    
Just like the one that k*ll...

Wh-What are you doing?    
I'm gonna lead it away. You stay here.    
Homer, no!    
Hey, you! Come and get the fat man!    
    
Oh, Homie.    
   
King of Nature!    
Destroyer of our planet!

Wait, what are you doing?    
Hey, no fair. Cut that out.

Hey, you don't want to eat me.
I'm stringy.    
Oh, who am I kidding? I'm marbled.    
I'm human Wagyu!

- MARGE: Leave him alone!    
    
Uh... please?

Marge, run! Marge, run! Marge...    
Homer.    
It's...    
it's dead.    
Marge! Oh, oh, are you hurt?    
I'm fine.    
No, no. No, you're not.    
Where's your shoe?    
    
Hmm.    
Oh...    
Hmm?    
Oh, Marge.    
    
Ooh!    
    
Did I surprise you?    
With that sexy wilderness musk,    
you're not sneaking up on anyone.    
    
Mmm!    
I'll go forage some more
moss for our love nest.    
And later,
I'll crotch milady a fish for dinner.    
Oh, sounds perfect.    
    
- 
- Hmm?    
    
    
Hey! Over here!    
Come back!    
Stop...!    
Aw, damn it.    
What happened? What is it?    
Oh, I screwed up.    
There was a park ranger right there.    
I should've yelled right away,    
but I looked at you
and our little house, and...    
and it... it was too late.    
I'm so sorry.    
I'm so stupid!    
Homie, Homie, Homie, I get it.    
But we've got to get out of here.    
Look... we can follow the tracks.    
There has to be a ranger station nearby.    
Okay, we'll pack up some water,
wolverine jerky...    
- And precious memories.
- Aw.    
No, that's the name of this love jelly    
I've been using as bug repellent.    
Say goodbye to the love shack.    
Aw.

Homer, wait. Wait.    
Just one more moment.    
    
From now on,
I'm gonna try to be more romantic,    
like the kids said.

Don't change anything.
