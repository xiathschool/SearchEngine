So what are you going to do without us numskulls To supervise?
I plan to fill the void with gardening, early dining, And I've been learning to speak mandarin chinese.
That's garbage, that's total garbage.
I'm going to miss ted.
He was a good supervisor.
Definitely hands-off.
He didn't mind if we punched in A little late or not at all.
Or that we made a few adjustments to the soda machine.
Yeah.
Beer.
Here's to us-- the unsupervisables.
I expect you're all anxiously awaiting My choice for your new supervisor.
Can't we just all supervise ourselves?
I win!
In any event, Much as what formerly was my kidney is now my heart, I have decided to promote from within.
One of you will get the job.
But which one?
Aah!
Hmm...
Congratulations.
I dub thee king of the morons, Also known as supervisor for sector 7-g.
Here is your key to the executive washroom.
Hmm.
Whoo-hoo!
Our boss is our best buddy.
The nitwits are running the goofhouse.
Yeah.
Hey, carl, why aren't you high-fiving?
You know, I'd rather save my arm-lifting For tapping gauges or filling out employee evaluations.
We can celebrate at moe's.
After work.
And the first beer's on me.
You see, he hasn't changed.
Yes, I have, In ways you're only beginning to suspect.
I call to order this meeting Of the springfield charity chicks.
As you all know, last year's cake and cookie sale raised $112 to fight childhood obesity.
Thank you, charity chicks.
Whoa!
Now, who has ideas For this year's fundraiser?
Well, the police department raised money By selling these beefcake calendars.
Ooh, that's quite a thing.
Yeah, great.
I have a great idea.
Let's do what they did but with us.
We are a good-looking bunch.
We just need a theme.
Hmm.
Ah!
How about history?
Then it's set.
We'll do it on the 25th of...
...Wiggum.
Okay, betsy ross, bring history to life.
Ooh, I love it.
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop.
Okay, stop, we got plenty.
All right, who's my next sexy historical lady?
I am.
The female tiger woods of the 1930s--
Babe didrikson zaharias.
Ooh, you know marge, if you want to sell calendars, I'm going to need to see More "babe" and less "didrikson zaharias."
Fine, I'll take off one glove.
Mm-hmm.
Hmm, you know what would look super good?
If you held this glass of red wine.
Mmm, I love this wine.
Yeah, it's andalusian.
Well, it seems real to me.
Okay, more wine for you.
Ooh, that's caliente, baby.
Ooh, ooh, Pop goes the chupacabra.
Whoop! Okay.
Mmm, oh, meow.
Meow, meow, meow.
Whoops!
Hey, carl, Look how I messed with the names On the softball sign-up sheet.
It's delicious.
You know how smitty's name is smitty?
Well, not anymore.
I changed the "m" to a...
That'll do, homer.
...To a "p"--
Spitty, 'cause he spits when he talks.
He had to have part of his tongue removed.
That's real funny.
Oh, well, I didn't know that.
Well, now you know.
Oh, quit dragging me.
When I grow up, I'm gonna drag you around And buy you clothes.
Oh, that's wonderful.
What's all the hubbub-aloo?
I've been pin-upped.
And every month is me.
I don't remember doing this.
I certainly don't remember doing August.

No.
Well, I got the next best thing.
Whoo-hoo.
Great safety report, homer.
No meltdowns all week.
I'm making you my new executive assistant.
Why can't I keep the job I have now, whatever it is?
Not an option, big fella.

Oh, fine, I guess I'm at your beck.
And call.
No...!
