Uh, hey there, chief.  
Uh, look, your mailbox hasn't been emptied in weeks.  
Oh, no, not the mail.  
What if I'm missing out on coupon packs, or perhaps a jury summons?  
How will I live without my paper e-mails?  
Eh, I get it.  
But be a pal, pally. Empty it out.   
Hmm, it has been baking in the sun for a while.   
I think it's done.   
   
   
Mail loaf!

Carve that mail. Carve it good.   
Who wants an end piece?   
Hmm...   
   
I'm invited to a birthday party at Addy's.   
Addy? Hmm, I don't know that friend.   
What subject does she teach?   
It's a kid! I know kids.   
It's a sleepover at Addy's house.   
- 
- Addy.   
I met her at the library.   
- Aha.
- Oh. - Library, Marge.   
We were the only ones who loved this old series   
of books, Gallop Girls.   
   
   
Mmm, old book smell.   
   
Mmm, new friend smell.   
   
What is the deal with girls and horses?   
Is it 'cause boys took all the good animals,   
like dogs and ninjas?   
Horses are nature's triumph.   
They have the perfect combination of power, grace and braidable hair.   
Dumb, dumb, stupid. Legs don't move.   
Ew. Pink?!   
Once cars were invented, why didn't they just k*ll all the horses... with the cars?   
b*at it, Summer School.   
Horse-a-copter attack.
Its plops are b*mb.   
   
   
Let her go. She's a rescue and uneasy around men.   
   
My paddock!   
   
Hey, hey, hey, hey. No horseplay.   
 Horseplay!   
Marge, guess what I said. Fight on.   
Why? Why do you always wreck the stuff I care about?   
Big brothers are supposed to be helpful and a little nice.   
I wish I could un-brother you.   
Not if I un-sister you first.   
Fine. By the power of safety scissors, I hereby sever the sibling bond.   
- Snip.

Wow.   
Look at that house.   
I bet they use their garage for cars.   
Horsey birthday!   
Your house is huge.   
Yeah, it's kind of embarrassing.   
My dad's the exclusive ketchup distributor for stadiums and megachurches.   
She's obviously lying. Ketchup is free.

Hi, I'm Marge.   
Lisa's really been looking forward to your daughter's party.   
Oh, no, I'm the party planner.   
The mother's on a photoshopping retreat to get her son into USC.   
Have fun. We'll see you tomorrow.

I'm not looking for your lost sunglasses.   
It's been six years. They're gone.   
You are always saying how I never make plans for us.   
Well, how about a sunset cruise?   
I only ever read about those in Sunset Cruise magazine.    
There's even live music.    
This is the band that was gonna play Lenny's wedding reception if he didn't get pepper-sprayed at the altar.

You're hilarious.
I will never stop laughing.    
    
Your friends seem, um, different than you.    
That one keeps saying things are funny, but she's not laughing.    
Oh, she can't.
Her mom got too much Botox when she was pregnant.    
Ugh, so lucky.    
I know they seem cliquey and stuck-up and...    
- Awful?
- Yeah.    
But once they accept you, you'll see that, deep down, they're... nice.    
Oh, good, good. So they're not mean.    
Oh, I almost judged them.

It's literally unusable.    
What about my gift?    
Look, it's got a little straw hat that fits right over his ears.    
    
She got her a toy.    
Does it come with a nappy?    
Oh, my God, I'm laughing so hard,    
I can't even breathe.    
Does it dispense bronzer?
Bronzer remover?    
What does it dispense? How is it makeup?

 Okay.
Full disclosure, I invited you because those other girls are always so mean to me.
