Fold down that... and then up that...and this and over there and you have a beautiful swan!  
What the...?!  
♪ ♪   
This is Anger Watkins, and you're watching basic cable's angriest sports show.   
Folks, this is difficult to say, but, today, I'm angry!   
I like how angry he is.   
I want to broach a topic that no one else has the airtime to fill to discuss.   
Greatest of All Time.   
LeBron, Kobe or MJ?   
I'll tell you why you're all wrong!   
Let's open the lines.   
The producer says I'm gonna go on.   
Please, Sports Jesus, guide my blather.   
Welcome to Rage Nation.   
What the hell is your problem?   
Uh, first-time listener,   
long-time caller.   
So, I, uh...   
Give me a take!   
Anger needs a take.   
Who is number one?   
Uh, John Stockton!   
John Stockton?!   
We're trying to have our daily conversation in which we rank and re-rank three demigods, and you bring John "Never Won a Title" Stockton into the mix?!   
Shame! For shame!   
   
Homer, you got flushed.   
A man who don't know sports, um, he ain't much of a man.   
You're nothing to me now. Just a husband and father.   
Stupid Anger Watkins flushing me with an audio effect.   
Why not eat your feelings with a cheer-up kebab?   
Let's see. Pizza slice, summer sausage...   
Here you go.   
It was only a dumb call-in show.   
Easy for you to say.   
If that jerk didn't like your sports notions, listen to someone else.   
The Internet's full of homemade sports shows.   
Anyone could put one on,   
- I mean, even...
- Don't say "you."   
Don't say "you."   
Even you.   
Damn it.   
Oh, yes. Of course!   
An Internet sports talk show!   
But where could I find a host who thinks all my opinions are great?   
 Me.   
Marge, prepare a congratulations kebab.   
   
   
These are hard as rocks.   
 Food fight!   
   
   
   
Uh, this calls for massive retaliation.   
Use your quadratic equations, men.   
   
   
Oh, my God. I'm having a flashback.   
   
Good Lord, I'm reliving the Tot Offensive.   
Skinner...    
I'll Heimlich you, sir.    
Just be still so I can embrace you from behind.   
   
Get... off... me.   
Shh, you're safe now.

Now, which of you little hoodlums tossed the first tot?   
- The nerd did it.
- Principal Skinner, it wasn't me. It was physics.   
Is this true, Fizix?   
I would've thought better of a Turkemenistani exchange student.   
Ah! I had nothing to do with it.   
I came to this country to escape food-based violence.

Welcome to Walkoff Homer!   
This is Homer Simpson,the rudest dude on the InnerTube.    
They say Muhammad Ali was the greatest of all time, but he never fought Cassius Clay.    
What was he afraid of?    
Boom! Hot take.    
And how come, in basketball, they use the basket all the time but you could literally play football without any feet?    
This show sucks.    
I can't believe he's wasting Flanders' Wi-Fi on this.    
Here's a few things that bug me.    
How can they call traveling on a home team?    
Why is soccer so stupid?    
How can they play hockey in a garden?    
Why can't golfers carry their own clubs?    
Lazy jerks.

My name's Warburton Parker.    
I'm a stranger to you.
Why should you listen to me?    
- You don't know my backstory.
- MARGE: Mm-hmm.    
Well, here it is... colon... as a child, my only friend was my computer.    
I was teased every day.    
Then I became a pro snowboarder, married a supermodel, went into tech, made a fortune, bought the factories where the kids who teased me's parents worked and shut the factories down.    
Do you have a backstory?    
Once, when I was six, I ate a radio.    
 I like you, but that won't get in the way.    
Let me cut to the chase.    
I make money from viral videos.    
And you two have gone viral.    
"Raccoon in a revolving door" viral.    
    
You're right to dance in such a fashion.    
Because I'll show you how to make videos    
- that will make you rich.

And me richer.    
And me richest.    
What are you doing here?    
 I get an alert whenever anyone's getting rich.    
    
Wow.  .million views!    
Wow! Good, not great.    
That's the population of Colorado.    
Is that the Broncos one?

- Aw.    
The question is, how much money have you made?    
Let's see. Uh, third quarter take...    
- Factor in overhead.
- Of course.    
- Overhead.
- Projections.    
Apples to apples.    
Figure net profit.    
Got it. Nothing.    
The question was rhetorical, you idiots.    

Sorry about the "idiots" thing.
