- Oh, dear. 
Oh, who am I kidding?   
I will never have enough money to go to San Diego.   
Oh, maybe next year.   
But how many "next years" do I have left?   
Leave me.   
I have no patience for buyers, sellers, or parking meter quarter needers.   
I didn't drag this wagon full of garbage to be yelled at by a talking circle!   
Ouch. Yes. Well, touché.   
Listen up, super size.   
I want to get rid of Seymour's toys before he turns   .   
Oh, let's see, nothing of value, nothing of val...   
Wait a minute.   
Oh, my God, this is why I nerd.   
Yes! An original Radioactive Man doll.   
Hmm, mint in box, too.   
Yes, I may have occasionally seen one of these.   
In my dreams!   
Yes, um, excuse me just for-for one moment.   
I might make money!   
Hulk smash! Hulk smash!   
Three, two, sold!   
At last, I can afford a trip to Comicalooza.   
Oh, but not enough money for my wife.

Oh, what luck.
And the first chance to wear my Doctor Octopus costume since my uncle's funeral.   
It is happening!

Mm.   
Do you still have it? Do you?

It's on its way to a lucky collector who will enjoy not opening it.

- Damn you, Mother.   
I haven't been this angry with you since you enlisted me in the Marines.   
Your draft number was too high.
The suspense was k*ll me.

Okay, don't gaze at his eyes.   
Don't stare at his smile.   
Don't talk out loud.

Settle, children, settle.   
First, we have a new band member.   
Blake, raise your hand.   
Second, we're having a chair challenge tomorrow.   
Lisa Simpson will be playing to retain her seat.   
Your challenger is Blake.   
Full disclosure, I'm pretty good.   
Well, I'm happy, 'cause whether I b*at you or not,

Stop with the blue eyes, will you?   
Less meet-cute, more toot-toot.   
   
Great. Now, keep playing.

"You come to me on the hay of my daughter's bedding and make me an ostrich I can't refuse."   
Uh, who are you?   
I'm Phil, filling in for Comic Book Guy.   
Also known as the Snark Knight and Mean Lantern.   
Stop being weird.   
I'm not being weird.
I'm a voice-over artist.   
I do voices for your favorite cartoons.   
Like Itchy the mouse.   
   
I never dreamed real people did those voices.   
I'm a little embarrassed to say this, but I do voices, too.   
Oh? Like who?
- Like this kid Nelson.   
You don't know him, but he's all...   
"haw-haw," and, "smell you later."

- Haw-haw!    
Smell you later.    
Hey, you're pretty good.    
And I do an awesome Todd Flanders, but it's not worth meeting Todd Flanders.    
- Do some more.
- Well, how about...    
That guy from Back to the Future.    
Kid, we've got to help your parents have sex.    
- Do another.
- : All right,    
I'll do Michael bloody Caine, if you don't mind.    
If you want to live in my cider house, there are some rules!    
Wow, if I knew who that was, I would be even more impressed.    
    
Do you ever worry that Lisa tries too hard and Bart doesn't try enough?    
Marge, you know our deal.    
 .    
Where is Bart, anyway?    
He should have been home by now.    
Can you call him?
I've got to get started on second dinner.    
Boy, where are you?    
I'm hanging with a stranger.    
He's got so many different personalities.    
Oh, will you be home before dark, yes or no?    
What am I, a magic  -ball?

Oh, don't patronize us, please.

Seen it all.    
Adam West in shorts, a line to meet Brendan Fraser.    
But you know the most amazing thing I ever saw?    
- What?
- Once, a guy asked a question so good, he got a job with Marvel on the spot.    
Ooh, me write for Marvel?    
Be a part of the committee that would decide the fate of the Avengers?    
Then people like me could make fun of me.    
But those ain't gonna cut it, fanboy.    
Then I will write the best question ever.    
Was he real or...    
Of course I'm real, and a real person should never be booked between you and this guy.    
I am Groot.    
Kosher meal for Steve Fishbein.    
I am Steve Fishbein.    
Comicalooza, even more glorious than I dreamed.    
    
I should not have done that.
Very stupid.    
Every man a Batman, every woman a Harley Quinn.    
The chance to rub elbows with the who's who of Dr. Who.    
And to ride an escalator next to Ant-Man Paul Rudd!    
You are Ant-Man Paul Rudd.    
Oh, god, I hate my approachable everyman looks.    
Yes, a question, please, from someone who is still willing to become a fan.    
If you had access to an Avengers-style quantum time loop, would you go back in time and not be in dinner for schmucks?    
Activate VIP pass.    
    
For two seconds
I saw inside the VIP room.    
I saw Jon Favreau sniffing hummus to see if it was still good.    
 Time for a celebratory pretzel.    
Rib-it, rib-it.    
Who are you?    
Boba Fett on a job interview.    
Well, begone. I'm writing the perfect panel question.    
Get out of here.    
    
Oh, my god. Oh, my god, I have it.    
"Are superheroes America's new religion?    
And if so, shouldn't comic book profits be tax-free?"    
    
I will work for Marvel, and they will finally be successful.    
Hey, good question.    
Thank you, Professor X.    
I'm not Professor X.    
I am just a bald man in a wheelchair searching for his child.    
- Hey, Lisa.
- Oh, hey, Blake.    
This is where I eat when I want to be alone.    
Uh, I don't want to be alone, though.    
Um, want to share wasabi peas?
They're really dry.    
Are you a veggie?    
- Yes, I am.
- Me, too.    
bread, lettuce and tomato.    
Hey, quit talking to my girlfriend.    
I am not your girlfriend.    
Right, right. We're focused on career days and homework right now.

See ya.    
Okay, a little bigger than I thought.    
Oh, boy, it's like Burning Man for nerds, although to be fair, Burning Man is also Burning Man for nerds.    
Man, there's a lot of nerds.    
Hello, Hall H.    
Let's let out a roar they can hear in Asgard.    
Question, isn't sound to Asgard blocked by the vacuum of space?    
Actually, sound is transmitted by Yggdrasil, the tree that connects the nine worlds of the cosmos.    
But transmission doesn't come into it.    
This has never not been true.

- Have you ever read Thor?    
Wha-what? Whoa.    
We have some of the greatest creators in the industry here.    
Daniel Kim, Zoe Burwell, and David Z. Cohen!    
    
Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god!    
I've been blocked on twitter by all of them.    
And now it's time for... audience questions.    
    
Yes. Third position.    
Time to prepare.
And just two steps to the mic.    
It's perfect.    
Um, I-I'd like to ask, how would someone like me get someone like you to-to look at my work?    
I'll look at your work.    
Uh, actually, uh, I-I don't...    
I don't have any work, per se.    
Next.    
Closer to me. Closer to me.    
    
Isn't it true that Superman represented the subconscious desire of creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster to defeat the n*zi menace in     ?    
Wow. Wow.    
I have never heard a question that good.    
    
Oh, yes, yes, good question.    
And I believe the answer is "a-doy." and now for the query that will blow them away.    
Uh, uh, where's my question?    
Ha, did I use it as a napkin?    
No, I never use a napkin.
Ugh, where is it?    
- Next!
- Um, uh...    
Yes, my question is, um, uh...    
Okay, I forgot my question.    
Worst question ever.    
- No!

Welcome to Marvel.    
No.    
We could offer you a job at DC.    
Yes, hard pass.    
Ugh. Just when I thought this day could not get any worse.    
    
chair challenges.    
We begin with Ralph challenging for first triangle.    
 I'm halfway through.    
Once again, first triangle will be an empty chair.    
The better chair won.    
Now, for first saxophone, Lisa Simpson.    
Hey, vegetarian, I soaked your reed

Ew, ew, ew.    
    
Terrible. Blake?

- Terrible, but better.    
- You're first chair.
-     
You were playing me the whole time.    
    
Don't you walk away from me.    
Well, very soon, I will outplay you, my blues will be blue-ier, my "Baker Street" will be more baked, and I will get my chair back.    
It may not be today, or tomorrow, because tomorrow we have a field trip, or two days after that because that's... that's no school, but-but on the   th.    
Yeah, the   th, it's mine, buddy.

Aah! Thanks for reminding me!    
    
Okay, audition for King of Cookie Castle, take one.    
Okay, you got this, Phil. Book it, book it good.

Off with their feet.    
Grind the rest into a sugary treat.    
Beautiful, you got the part.    
Beautiful, you got the fart.
    
 Hey, the kid's not bad.    
We might have a part for him, too.    
And if he improvises like that, I can fire the writers.    
Read this, kid.    
Eat my tights.    
- You're hired.

Who knew it was so easy to become a working actor?    
Hmm.    
Okay, everyone say one thing they did today.    
I'll start.    
I lost my half-cup measuring cup, so I used two quarter cups.    
Crisis averted.    
I booked a voice-over job, and the show airs tomorrow.    
I thought animation took nine months.    
No, you can do any cartoon in a day.    
Anyone who takes longer is just trying to bleed the studio dry.    
And this is what they're paying me.    
 That's baloney.    
Anybody could fake a check from...    
"Warner Bros. Animation." no, it's legit.

Keep your hands off the moneymaker.    
And don't look me in the voice.    
 Lisa, how was your day?    
Well, my life is in ruin, and I'm trying to think of some possible plan to rescue myself.    
Plans are fine, but never underestimate the power of giving up.

Now get a good look.    
This is your last chance to see normal Bart before I become a star.

Boo-yeah.    
    
Yeah, go, Bart.

For my problem, there's no answer.    
But what you're doing is brave, and it's a little dangerous, and you should be proud.

From now on, hands off Bart.    
What about me?    
I like the bullying.
It's a form of attention.    
Also, hands off Milhouse.    
No.
