Wait a minute. They did
a documentary about this place.   
   
No, it didn't happen that way.   
There was different music.   
   
Hmm?   
Quiet Rivers?!   
They changed the "ruh" to a "qwah."   
Did you know about this?   
I told you they changed
the name before we left.

Hey! Where are your cutoffs?

Aw, you kids don't know,

And the best slide of

Think of it.

Yeah, nothing gets the heart pumping

Aw. The quiet rivers in
my tummy are becoming...

Have you been to Costco?

I've been juicing

Oh, honey, you seem down in the dumps.    
And I know why.    
You do?     
Because it's really hard
to talk about when...    
Of course.
I don't know what I was thinking...    
by not taking you shopping
for back-to-school clothes.    
Wait, wha...?    
Oh. Nothing upside downs my frowns    
like a girls' trip to the mall.    
I don't know, Mom.    
I'm just not feeling it.    
Mm.    
 Can I get it? Can I get it?    
    
Hmm. I'm not sure that's a fit.

disaster on this kid!    
Forget it, Mom. Let's just go.    
Nuh-uh.    
We're not leaving this mall    
until we find you a really fun ensemble.    
    
That is so the look.    
Yes, I think that is the look.    
Mom, it's too big!    
No, it's not.    
It's very flattering.    
It's not your job    
to constantly comment on my appearance!    
But, honey, I could never pull that off.    
On you, it's so eye-catching.    
Oh, you are slaying those tens.

Ugh! Get this thing off of me!

No!    
    
Um, let's take a little fro-yo break.    
You can't fix everything with fro-yo!    
 That's what you acted
like before the medicine.    
Young lady, in this family,
we put clothing back on the hanger    
so the salesperson will
think we're classy!    
Why are you acting like
such a cranky pants?    
Stop talking to me about clothes!    
How's everything going in here?
I brought twelves.    
Do we need more twelves in here?    
This mall is an as*ault

Oh, look who got a visit
from the pube fairy.    
Dude, those aren't pubes.    
Yeah-huh. Everything new is a pube.    
So, Simpson,
you got your eyes on any ladies?    
Uh, yeah, I'm talking to a
couple dozen honeys right now.    
I'm in love with most of 'em,    
but right now,
I want to keep my focus on the gym.

- Pizza rolls are hot!    
Uh, what about our reps?    
There's plenty of time for that...    
after a weight fight!    
    
    
Working out is awesome!    
We don't slam doors in this house!
    
    
    
So, uh, how was the mall?    
Apparently, I'm the worst mother
in the world for being nice.    
Lisa had a huge tantrum in
front of the cell phone jewelry.    
I've asked her a hundred
times what the problem is,    
and she won't tell me.    
Can you talk to her?    
Of course, honey.    
Time for me to earn my
"World's Greatest Dad" mug.    
You bought that for yourself
in the hospital gift shop    
while I was giving birth.    
We both left with
something special that day.    
    
Honey,    
if something's bothering you,    
you got to let it out.    
Like swallowed burps,    
buried feelings can burst
out at the worst possible...    
    
Mom called me "chunky."    
Oh, my God.    
Marge did the one thing no
parent is ever supposed to do...    
acknowledge what their
children look like!    
Oh, what do I say to make it better?    
I know. I'll tell her Marge
isn't her real mother,    
and Lisa and I should
pack up and leave forever.    
No, something about that feels wrong.    
Hmm, I must use an entire lifetime    
of fatherly knowledge
to help my daughter.    
    
Buying versus leasing... pros and cons.    
How many miles do you think
you'll be driving a year?    
Thanks for trying, Dad.    
- That is what you were doing, right?
- Yes.    
I can't expect you to
understand my problem.    
I just wish I didn't care
what people think.    
Honey, if you didn't care,
you wouldn't be human.    
 Not human, I say.    
Here we are.    
When you called for help,
I was hoping you needed someone    
to spell-check your su1c1de note.    
And just so we're clear,
you dented cue ball,    
we're not doing this for you.    
We're here for Lisa.    
Hey, look who stopped by!    
How would you like to go on a
completely spontaneous outing    
with your aunts?    
- Uh...
- In our world, that's a "yes."    
We heard what your mother said.
Not cool.    
We only use "chunky"
to describe jewelry and stew.    
And since we've had
stew for breakfast...

Lisa, your dad told me
why you've been upset.    
I'm so sorry for what I said.    
It was a mistake, and I feel terrible.    
Thanks, Mom, but spending the afternoon    
with Aunt Patty and Selma
made me feel a lot better    
about myself.    
And also, a lot worse
about everyone else.    
Mm. Why couldn't I just
