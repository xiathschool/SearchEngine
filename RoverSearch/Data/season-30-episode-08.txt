title: Krusty the Clown


Hubert, great work on the cafeteria gravy story.  
Answered a lot of questions but raised a lot more.  
  
news.  
The Daily Fourth Gradian is hemorrhaging money.  
Last month the paper lost...  
$  .  
   
But you can't put a price on the truth.   
I finally got a source to go on the record about dodgeball concussions.   
b*mb, b*mb.   
b*mb.   
I'm sorry, but I have no choice but to bring in a new editor.

Preschool is over, news skanks.   
Today is gonna be like Carrie Underwood hosting the Country Music Awards... we're in for a lot of changes.   
You... I can tell you're a real talent.   
Get out. You're fired.   
See? No one's safe.   
Fidget spinner.   
What are you doing?   
Hubert's a good journalist.   
Good journalism ain't paying the pizza man, toots.

You bet your book bag I won't.

I hate you so much I'm giving you the most important job at this swipe rag.

- I'm a recapper.   
Huh? What?   
A TV recapper.   
I watch every episode of a show, then write a summary, followed by snarky comments and a letter grade.   
Well, sometimes I do worry I have the wrong opinions about what I've just seen.   
   
   
Ugh. This isn't me.   
What kind of person can just spew out an endless stream of knee-jerk reactions?   
They should hand out candy at Thanksgiving and stuffing at Halloween.   
Say, Dad, you sure have a lot of strong opinions.   
Why don't you watch this show and tell me what you think?

Hey, yeah. Ah!   
Ta-da!   
   
Mm-hmm.   
Hmm.   
The mouse and the cat hate each other.   
That feels real to me.   
It was quite a ride, and I was on board until the shawarma screamed. Huh.   
Very disappointing.   
An instant classic.   
Dad, you were born to describe TV at a fourth-grade level.   
Ooh, well.   
Would you recap The Krusty Show for my school paper?   
All you have to do is watch TV and say things about it.   
Just say things about TV.

Krusty, a recapper is now reviewing your show.   
Let me see that.

"Pie clearly hits face of stunt double"?   
"Overuse of comedic rule of three"?!   
 Why would I possibly care about the opinion of this pathetic bottom feeder?

Oh, you're okay.    
All right, tell me who as*ault you, and we'll bring 'em in.

 Ah.

The circus? Why?    
You're a clown.    
I won't stand here and be insulted!    
Y... Oh, right.    
Kid, I'm a TV clown not like these trapeze-sucking tent-fluffers.    
Circus clowns don't talk, while I perform to camera with finely honed subtlety.    
Hey-hey!     
 Easy on the "hey-heys."    
The cops are looking everywhere for you.    
I can't go to jail.    
I just quit smoking. What do I do?    
Huh?    
So, what do you call yourself?    
- Soggy. Soggy the Clown.
- Thought we already had a Soggy.    
Nah, nah, you're thinking of Moisty.    
You're hired.    
So, Soggy, uh, what's your act?    
Well, I can introduce cartoons, pretend to enjoy children's breakfast cereal.    
Oh, and I completely blow my stack when someone takes my parking space.    
You sound like a... TV clown.    
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.    
I hate TV clowns from how you just said that.    
 TV clowns. Riding four to a car like royalty, eating their stew from a bowl instead of cupped hands.    
Krusty.    
Wait. Circus clowns hate Krusty?    
Don't you?    
In my way I've hated him all my life.    
Yeah, you get it, Soggy.
You're a good kid.    
Anyway, this is where you eat, this is where you sleep, and this is where you sweep up the elephant crap.    
So, all three in this cage.    
Efficient, right?    
Now meet the finest clowns from the greatest closed circuses in the world.    
Skitters, Bumpo, Wiggles, Clabby, Dr. Pickles, Mr. Bindle, Barrels, Drooly, Trembles, Blitzy, Handsy, Boobsy, Mr. Boobsy, Baby Boobsy, the Boobsy Twins, Ding-a-ling, Bing-bong, Ring-a-ling, Flip-Flop, Fiddle-Faddle, Flap-Jack, and Scene Blow.    
Nice to meet...    
    
Yeah.    
    
It's him. It's really him.    
 A regular dork and a girl one.    
It is an honor to meet the man whose recaps were so devastating that the star of the show tried to k*ll him.    
The secret is, say what happened.    
Oh, it's like we're talking to Hemingway.

Homer, I'm the CEO of a major media conglomerate.    
We can't have you quit.    
You're one of America's top recappers.    
I had to quit; recapping was ruining my marriage.    
There were so many shows, I couldn't keep up.    
It's true. Currently there are over     scripted shows on network, cable, and streaming.    
Why are you making so many shows?    
No one could watch more than     of them.    
Oh, we don't care if people watch.    
We just care if they subscribe    
- for $   a month.
-     
You see, if people subscribe but don't watch, then we don't actually have to make the shows.    
We just need viewers to believe they can watch them.    
Fake shows?    
But what if people try to see them?    
They won't, because recappers like you will give those shows a B-minus.    
No one ever watches a B-minus.    
But, but that's crazy.    
It could never work.    
It already has.    
Are you familiar with the USA Network?    
Sure. Royal Pains, Suits, White Collar.    
Have you ever seen any of those shows?    
No, but somebody must have...    
Surely somebody...    
There is no USA Network.    
There hasn't been for    years.    
It's just bus ads!    
Oh, my God.

Your plan is insane.    
Perhaps.    
But not as insane as making...    
that... many... shows.    
I never had faith in God or family, but I had faith in television.

There's got to be a way to keep this place running.    
If we only had    grand, we could start over with a new name and a new act.    
Yeah. We can get the Flying Branzinos.    
Nobody pickpockets a crowd like those guys.
