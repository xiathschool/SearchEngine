Full price.   
Money is my oxygen.

It's working.   
The stupid kids fell for it!   
   
Lisa, I got you one with a patty   
that's    % veggie.   
Yeah, the burgers never had actual meat,   
but somehow the sodas do.   
I swore I'd never eat
a hamburger sandwich   
made by that clown.   
I got my reasons.   
Oh, Abe, you and your reasons.   
   
I'm sorry you're upset,   
but it's nice to have someone
to be a little grumpy with.   
Yup, we've always had a special   
Grampa-Lisa connection.   
You know, we do.   
I call it "Grampsa."   
Oh, that's why you always say that.
   
One pillowcase worth of
  -cent Krusty burgers, please.   
How are you gonna carry
all these burgers?   
Pillowcase full of pillowcases.    
Boy, I finally have
something to pass onto you,    
cheeseburger-ational wealth.    
I've never loved you more.    
Well, at least
they're having a good time.    
It'll never last.    
Every time a Simpson
thinks he's got it made,

Yeah, yeah, hey, hey.
Sarah, get this yutz a headshot

 Hey, it's you.    
Worth-A-Try Burger, right?
You doing good?    
I'm the ninth richest
man in the world now.    
 Okay, warmest regards.    
You stole my restaurant    years ago.    
I plotted and waited until
your moment of triumph    
   
I just bought your parent company,    
and you're finished.    
You are immediately
fired from Krusty Burger,    
The Krusty the Clown Show,
and Krusty Enterprises.    
You can no longer call yourself
"Krusty the Clown,"    
"Krusty," or "Clown,"    
and we own all your
slide whistle noises.    
    
You think you got me, huh, big sh*t?    
Well, let's see what my loyal fans    
think about that.

Attention, me-worshipping nobodies,    
I am the v*ctim of a coup.    
This evil billionaire just
stabbed me in the back!

- We love you, Krusty!    
All burgers are now    cents.    
Let our new hero speak!    
    
    
- Hand over your side hair.
-     
- And the top knot.

I finally have what any
billionaire businessman wants,    
total revenge    
on the clown who stole his dream.    
I only wish that I
could share this moment    
with my dear old partner
from Worth-A-Try Burger,    
who helped me launch that dream    
   years ago.    
Old partner?  That's me.    
No, it's not, Dad.    
Nothing is you.    
Abe Simpson, it is you.

My old friend,    
I am about to change your life.    
Dad, it's not you!    
Hey, hey, kids.
These burgers are "Worth a try."    
And don't forget    
the fries.    
    
    
Wow, look at that crowd.    
Who would've thought a clown
could sell hamburgers?    
This Krusty guy falling into our laps    
is the best thing that ever
could've happened to us.    
Give me more cash.    
But we already cut you in
for a third of the business.    
Without me, there is no business.    
I finally found my true
purpose as an artist,    
selling cheap meat to fat kids.    
Now give me half, or I walk.    
Come on, what's it gonna be?

Tough banana skins.    
And now to never regret this.    
Welcome to Krusty Burger!    
Yay!    
And the burgers come faster than ever,    
thanks to my patented
"Krusty Triple Flopper."    
We knew he stole jokes,    
but entire casual dining business plans?    
Well, Abe, the way I see it,
when you get screwed over,    
give up or fight.    
I'm a fighter,
and I don't care how long it takes,    
I'm gonna get revenge on that clown.    
Are you with me?    
    
    
I never let myself get stepped on again.    
I ruthlessly built an empire    
till I was rich enough to ruin Krusty    
and own six cable networks,    
several deep-sea diamond mines,    
and a company that makes
three-wheeled motorcycles    
for old weirdos.    
Whoa.    
Abe, now that I've got
our burger business back,    
I need you by my side.    
I want you to sit on
my board of directors.    
Grampa, you love sitting.    
The board is meeting
in New York on Monday.    
    
    
    
Wow, Dad, now you can be a Republican    
because you're rich and greedy,    
and not because you're old    
and don't know how
to change the channel.    
But what if I blow it?
Like I did all those years ago.    
That's the Simpson curse.    
But this time,
you've got a brilliant businessman    
like Gus on your side.    
You can break the curse.    
Okay, honey, I'll do it,    
but only if you come with me.    
- Me?
- Yeah.    
I can't do this without "Grampsa."    
Oh, then I'm in.    
Dad, since you've got a rich friend,    
what about our special bond?    
What about "Gromer"?    
"Hampa"?    
What about "Abe-Ho"?    
Is that a bond? Is it?

Dad, as we speak,
there are   ,    influencers    
at my island music festival.    
Too bad the bands haven't shown up,    
and there's no food, toilets,
or ways off the island.    
 No biggie, nobody died.    
    
- Well, nobody famous died.

Okay, I hope none of you
like Kenny Chesney.

Lisa, why don't we get some fresh air?    
Are you enjoying the valley?    
Because we could totally
change it to Mount Everest.    
Well, we already rode
them down the Giza pyramid    
and up the Burj Khalifa.    
Yes, let's head back to the stables.    
 Oh, wheatgrass.    
No, that's for the horses.    
Oh, phew. I've been pretending
to like it for years.    
My dad has done nothing
but ruthlessly build    
his empire for decades,    
but flipping burgers with your grandpa    
was the first time    
I've ever seen him at peace.    
That's wonderful.    
It's terrible.
He's gone soft in the head.    
Really? He seems pretty with it.    
Then why would he give
a seat on the board to a man    
who tried to make a phone call    
with a box of raisins?    
Oh, I was hoping you didn't see that.    
Grampa calls the raisins
"phone berries."    
But I think this is
a golden opportunity.    
Imagine how a progressive,    
Earth-loving woman like me    
could change the course
of this regressive,    
Earth-hating company.    
Oh, rebranding.    
And not just performative.    
    
For instance, we'd provide    
more opportunities for...    
...polar bears.    
 They're the only creatures    
I wish had white privilege.    
It's so exciting.    
My dad is stepping down
and giving control to me.    
That's amazing.    
It's all gonna happen on Monday,    
when your grandfather
votes to force him out.    
- What?
- MAV: Uh...    
it's my turn in the room.    
Ew.    
Dad, look what they've done
to Krusty's show.    
Up-bup-bup. You can't call him    
that name anymore, or we'll get sued.    
    
It's the Herschel The Comical Man Show.    
I'm your announcer, Nothing Mel.    
And here's a performer
who's not violating    
any termination agreement
implied or in writing.    
Him.    
Hee-hoo, kids.    
Say hi to Mr. Teeny-Dog,    
who's not affiliated
with Krusty Enterprises,    
its designees, or assigns.    
Haw-haw! You don't control your own I.P.    
    
 That sure drained the confetti    
from his fire bucket.    
    
Dad is losing it,    
and what are these "hamburger"
things he's making us eat?    
I can't touch food with my hand skin.    
Are you sure we've got the votes    
to oust him at the meeting Monday?    
Don't worry.
I'm just about to seal the deal
