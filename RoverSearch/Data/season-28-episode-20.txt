I know what you're thinking.   
 This must be some kind of prank.   
 Is there laxative in the punch bowl?   
 Well, there is, but their doctors prescribed that.   
 I've changed.   
 I've become pinchable.   
 You look confused.

Simpson. Those lyrics are unapproved and not that funny.   
Come with me.   
Hey, Skinner.   
Sure, you're tough enough to punish a little boy, but what about a Marine Corps veteran?   
Oh.   
Mm-hmm.   
Okay, Seymour.   
Note to my mom or detention?   
Which of your two lame w*apon are you gonna unleash on me?   
I have other w*apon.   
I have no other w*apon.   
Seymour, walk me to the bus stop.   
Mother, what are you doing here?   
I wanted to make sure you remember that I think your job is stupid.   
Simpson, I thought of your punishment.   
Bart here will walk you to the bus stop.   
That'll k*ll two birds with one stone.   
   
First time a worm ever k*ll a bird.   
   
Okay, Lenny, don't be nervous.   
This is the big one.   
Gotcha! Where am I?   
 You walked in the core.   
Yeah, we better seal this thing up tight.   
   
I'm playing Peekimon Get, see?   
That's a wild Rotata.   
That has got to be the stupidest game I've ever heard of.   
Oh, yeah, you're right. It's really a kids' game.   
And it's silly for me to...   
Quiet, I'm playing it.

Oh.    
Agnes!   
Oh, you just missed my perfect little Martin.   
Eh, I saw him.   
He's beefing up, that's for sure.   
Don't you love Grandparents' Day?   
I get to meet all the little boys Martin snitches on.   
Is that your grandson?    
Or is this just a... a pity walk?    
- He's not...

I love my Gam-Gam.    
Ha. You hear that?

I can't believe Martin left you alone

Thanks, Peaches.    
You're a gift to this world.

Give me your sweater.    
But-but without it, I'm nippley.    
    
You hear that? Oh, no...    
Nippley.    
I always wanted a grandson.    
A cute little guy I could take to the circus and the movies.    
Someone I could spoil rotten.    
I'm halfway there, ma'am.    
Well, this is my bus.    
Goes right by the candy store, eh?    
Don't take my mother, I need her to make me French toast!    
Egg yolks scare me...    
Ooh, a Rattlesnitch.

Now that's a spicy Peekiball.    
Got it.    
    
And so... Aw, I didn't get it.    
Won't anyone help me?    
Got it, and no.    
Now Maggie, there's no monster under your bed.    
Ooh, there is one on your face.    
Oh, man, there's like a million in here.    
Here's the phone, so you can see them.    
Nighty night.    
     
In the gospel according to Luke, uh...    
 If you two don't mind.    
Look this game is, or at least was, bigger than Jesus, okay?    
Hmm, that's a pretty low bar these days.    
Ah, Skunk-a-san.    
Why can't I capture you?    
 It's real!    
D'oh!    
    
    
Sprayed by a skunk.    
Homie, that game's too dangerous.    
The game was fine.    
Reality was dangerous.    
And could you move a little to your left?    
There's a Stumble-Bee right behind you.    
Oh, is there any fad you don't take too far?    
The aerobics ones.    
Mom, what Dad could use is a co-player, who makes sure he doesn't get hurt.    
Because the game is good for him.    
You can see that he's lost weight from the walking.    
I'm using the factory holes on my belt.    
Oh, wow. Wow.    
Lisa, why are you interested?    
Because it's the greatest game ever.    
In this world, I can throw a ball.    
Hmm, okay.    
    
I'd prefer if you didn't turn your skunk bath into a giant cocktail.    
Ugh. One damn rule after another around here.

So it turns out you can buy Peeky creatures with real money.    
But the fun of the game is catching them, not buying them.
