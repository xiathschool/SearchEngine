Oh, thanks for bringing me up here, Dad.   
It's magnificent.   
Ugh, I could really use it after what happened today.   
Aw, sweetie, are you still mad about that big dumb jerk at school?   
She's my teacher.   
And her name is Miss Hoover.   
It's unforgivable what she did.   
What was it again?   
   
Breakfast!   
Here you go.   
Melon?! Ugh.   
Marge, no one dreams of waking up to the sounds of frying melon.   
- Yeah, Marge.
- See?   
Your fruit breakfast has turned him into a first name user.   
For once, could this family start the day with fruit instead of greasy animal fat?

Look at me. I'm eating healthy.   
   
 You win.   
I'll make bacon.   
Put away the gravy boat.   
They say the best days of a gravy boat owner's life are the day you get it and the day you get rid of it.   
   
No, Bart, stop!   
This is my mobile for my "Who Inspires You?" project.   
it's gravity.
The ultimate suck-up.   
 Can't spell "gravity" without "gravy."

The subject I have chosen for my mobile is this lady.   
Ta-da!   
Of course. Yes. Her. Absolutely.   
The woman who lives at the center of the Earth.   
It's Gladys West, the mathematician whose work in satellite geodesy helped create GPS.   
GPS. The invention that k*ll the "I got lost" excuse.   
- Oh, gee, I'm sorry, Marge.   
I just can't find the restaurant for your sisters' birthday.   
Your destination is    feet ahead.   
Shut up.   
   feet ahead.   
Shut up!   
   feet ahead.

You have now arrived at Lovely Ladies Cigar Lounge.   
You'll be cutting and serving the us-shaped cake.

Curse you, Gladys West!

How about this girl?   
Her grades and test scores are superb.

Accept. Full ride.

Ah, wha... how did I get here?

Is Miss Hoover out sick?   
No, I'm in sick.   
I sprained a disc in my back.   
It feels like I'm passing a kidney stone while giving birth.   
I say "excuse me" when I give burps.   
Not the same, Ralph.    
Fortunately, my new Teaching With Stylus tablet lets me run the classroom from any position.    
-  Let's get inspired.
You might think "German chocolate cake" originated in Germany, but nein.    
Actually, it was invented by an American mill worker named Samuel German.    
    
I'm from America but my measles are German.    
I'm inspired by The Masked Singer and...    
It doesn't come off. Help!    
Help! Help...!    
I know these presentations are boring and everyone hates them, so...

Okay. That's it.    
Now put the supplements to your reports on my desk.    
Give me a sec to post the grades.    
A B-minus? No, no.    
This can't be right.
This can't be right.    
The same grade as Ralph?!
Sorry, Ralph, no offense.    
There's "a fence" around my bed so I don't steal things from Daddy's squad car again.    
Chief, did you tell Snake he could have jail outside today?    
- 'Cause that's what he's saying.
- WIGGUM: Leave me alone.    
Listen, Miss "took too long on her presentation," it's not only right, it's easy with my "Select All" B-minus option.    
Miss Hoover, this is so unfair.    
I come here every day eager to learn and you just put me down and complain about your job.    
In the end, what are you?    
You're just somebody who works off a formula that leaves no room for passion, individual effort, or the process of learning itself.    
- Mm.
- In other words, you're an uninspiring hack!    
Apologize immediately.    
No. I told the truth.    
The truth has no place in this classroom.    
Lisa, go to detention.

I was going to encourage Lisa to apologize.    
But I shouldn't have to.    
Women say "I'm sorry" constantly because men make us feel like we have to apologize for existing while they do whatever they like.    
Yo. Milhouse is sleepin' over.

- Wah!
- Ready to apologize, Lisa?

I'm just glad I won't have you next year as a teacher.    
I might just move to third grade to torment you.    
That would be a real hack move.    
Ugh!    
Freshen it up.

- Love it.    
Personally, I never say I'm sorry.    
I say "I'm soggy." Teachers hear what they want.

Miss Hoover?
 In reference to our recent difficulty, I would just like to say    
I'm soggy.

In addition to a hack, you must think I'm a fool.

- So, when apologizing from your heart, saying sorry allows the healing process to begin.    
- Sorry I'm late.
- What?! - She's sorry?    
Yeah, I've heard that one a lot.    
Well, I don't mind saying I'm sorry when it's appropriate.    
Appropriate. Never heard of that word.    
I know "inappropriate."    
- True. So true.
- Oh, yes, yes.    
Now, to truly apologize, I find it helps to look at the world from the other person's perspective.

- What am I supposed to do after you called me a hack?    
In retrospect, I might have been wrong.    
The sad truth is apologies can come too late to do any good.
