Welcome, swappers... to the Springfield Swap Meet.
Ich bin ein Springfield Swap Meet patron.
I need a drink and a shower.

 Oh, Mr. Mooney, I just gotta meet Bob Cummings!

Oh, boy! Free trading cards!
Wow!Joseph of Aramathea!
Twenty-six conversions in A.D. 46!
Whoa! A Methuselah rookie card!
Who'd have thought learning about religion could be fun?
Religion?
Learning?
Let's get outta here!
Hey!
Wow! An original Malibu Stacy from I 958!
Ooh!
Yeah, they took her off the market after some kid put both his eyes out.
Oh, my!
I wore this for two years in a Vietcong internment center.
Never thought I'd see the old girl again.
 Still fts.
Small world, huh?
It is. It really, really is.
Ooh, five cents each.
Junk.
Junk.
The airplane's upside-down.
Stradi-"who"-vius?
Your teenage son or daughter will think this wishbone necklace is really cool.
I doubt my son or daughter is that stupid.
Hmm. Nah.
What the hell's this?

Melvin!
 Bart, look. It's Dad!
Dad, when did you record an album?
I'm surprised you don't remember, son.
It was only eight years ago.
Dad, thanks to television, I can't remember what happened eight minutes ago.
No, really. I can't. It's a serious problem.
 What are we all laughing about?
Who cares?
Anyway, it all happened during that magical summer of I 985.
A maturing Joe Piscopo left Saturday Night Live to conquer Hollywood.
People Express introduced a generation of hicks to plane travel.
And I was in a barbershop quartet.

Barbershop? That ain't been popular since aught-six, dag-nab it!
What did I tell you?
No talking like a grizzled I 890s prospector. Consarn it.
Anyway, rock and roll had become stagnant.
"Achy Breaky Heart" was seven years away.
Something had to fill the void.
And that something was barbershop.

Homer, I'm a theatrical agent. I want to represent your group.
Really?
Yeah, you've got it.
All except that police officer. Yuck! Too Village People. You'll have to replace him.
Just leave it to me.
 Where we goin'? Where we goin'?
Run along, boy. You're free now.

Principal Seymour Skinner.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon.
Eh, never fit on a marquis, luv.
From now on your name is Apu de Beaumarché.
It is a great dishonor to my ancestors and my god, but okay.
 The next day, we started auditioning for Chief Wiggum's replacement.

Hey, those girls you paid to scream are doing a great job!
I didn't pay any girls to scream.
Huh?
 Boy! We sounded great, huh?
Only one question remains, gentlemen. What do we call ourselves?
How about Handsome Homer Simpson, Plus Three?
I like it!
I do not-- I do not think--
No. We need a name that's witty at first... but seems less funny each time you hear it.
How about the Be Sharps?
Perfect.
The Be Sharps.
The Be Sharps.
 The Be Sharps.
 The Be Sharps.
Why, you can't blame a guy for tryin'. 
Oh, you're all under arrest.
What'd you kids get?
I bought this cool pencil holder.
 Far out, man. I haven't seen a bong in years.
No one bought a wishbone necklace.
One of us made some money. I sold a guy our spare tire.
D'oh!
Well, it'll be a long time before your mother gets back with the tire... so why don't I tell you more of the story?
Now that we had a name, the Be Sharps needed a hit.
Something new, something exciting, something mid-1 980s.

Gentlemen, you've just recorded your first number one.
Oh, yes!
Yes! Wait till I tell Marge!
Oh, yes. Bouffant Betty.
Well, I would prefer we kept your marriage a secret.
A lot of women are going to want to have sex with you... and, uh, we want them to think they can.
Well, if I explain it to Marge that way, I'm sure she'll understand.
Come on, honey.
It'll only be till we finish our tour of Sweden.

Homer, you're going to be famous!
Yeah, but I'm not gonna let it change our lives.
I'll be the same loving father I've always been.
Have you seen Bart?
I stuck him somewhere.
Look what I got for you, Dad.
Oh, Home-- 
Gimme the key.
I have a question for Apu de Beaumarché.
Isn't it true that you're really an lndian?
By the many arms of Vishnu, I swear it is a lie.
Barney, how did you join the group?
They found me on the men's room floor.
Principal Skinner--
Mm-hmm?
You've been referred to as "the funny one."
Is that reputation justified?
Yes. Yes, it is.

Damned ceremonies. This is time I could be working, Mommy.
We'd like to dedicate this next number to a very special woman.
She's I 00 years old, and she weighs over 200 tons.
This enormous woman will devour us all! Aaah!
I-- I meant the statue.
Okay. Gilligan, the Skipper, and Chief Wiggum.
Name three castaways.
Hi-oh.!
Ooh!
Clancy, use the remote.
Oh, yeah.
Oh! Can we talk about Chief Wiggum? 
We had fame and fortune.
Now all we needed was the approval of record company lowlifes.
And the Grammy for outstanding soul, spoken word... or barbershop album of the year goes to--
The Be Sharps!
 Yea!
Congratulations!
David Crosby, you're my hero!
Oh, you like my music?
You're a musician?
 Then came the greatest thrill of my life.
Hello, Homer. I'm George Harrison.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Where did you get that brownie?
There's a big pile of'em.
Oh, man.
What a nice fellow.
Lisa, did you see the Grammys?
You b*at Dexy's Midnight Runners.
You haven't heard the last of them.
I miss you, Daddy.
I miss you too, honey.
Oh.
Here's that champagne you ordered, Mr. Simpson.
Oh, thanks.
Here.
Wow! An award statue!
Oh, it's a Grammy.
 Hey, don't throw your garbage down here.!
Wow, look at all this Be Sharps merchandise!
Lunch boxes, coffee mugs... funny foam.
They took the foam off the market because they found out it was poisonous.
But if you ask me, if you're dumb enough to eat it, you deserve to die.
Bart!
What?
I can't believe you're not still popular.
What'd you do? Screw up like the b*at and say you were bigger than Jesus?
All the time. It was the title of our second album.
But we were about to learn an iron law of show business.
What goes up must come down.
What about Bob Hope? He's been consistently popular for over 50 years.
So has Sinatra.
Well, anyway, we were all getting tired of--
Dean Martin still packs 'em in.
Ditto Tom Jones.
Shut up!
With your father on the road all the time, I tried to compensate for his absence.
 Aaah!
 Aaah!

This is worse than your song about Mr. T.
I pity the fool who doesn't like... he.
And where's Barney?
Oh, he's with his new girlfriend... theJapanese conceptual artist.
 Barbershop is in danger of growing stale.
I'm taking it to strange new places.
 Number eight.
 Number eight.
Then came the day we knew we were finished.
Gentlemen, Us magazine just came out with its what's hot and what's not issue.
Are we hot?
We are not.
 We all went our separate ways.
Well, William, I'm back.
So, how did you spend your summer?
I made millions in software and lost it at the track. Ach!
It may not be glamorous, but it's good, honest work.
How much is this quart of milk?
Twelve dollars.
Hey, Barney, what'll it be?
I'd like a beer, Moe.
I'd like a single plum floating in perfume, served in a man's hat.
Here you go.
Hey, fellas. I'm back.
Oh, that's great. Your replacement is getting tired.
Hey, Queenie, you can go now.
I'll give her a good home.
And I did.
I'll never forget my five and a half weeks at the top.
Man, that's some story.
There are still a few things I don't get.
Like, how come we never heard about this until today?
What happened to the money?
Why haven't you hung up your gold record?
Since when could you write a song?
There are perfectly good answers to those questions... but they'll have to wait for another night.
Now off to bed.
I can't remember the last time we were all together.
Last year, on that stupid Dame Edna special.

Come on! I stayed up all night dyeing my underwear.
