title: I'm Dancing as Fat as I Can


- Mmm. Bleh.
- D'oh!  
  
Y'ello.  
Dad, I'm sleeping over at Milhouse's and I can't take it.  
Come on, Bart, read me to sleep.  
And do the voices.  
"I'm ruler,"   
said Yertle.   
"Of all that I see."   
Could we try that again?   
And hit "I'm" a little harder.   
"I'm ruler,"
said Yertle.   
Faster and this time hit "said."   
That makes no sense.   
Okay, we'll do it your way, then my way, and I'll see what works in editing.    
Dad, get me outta here.   
Sorry, boy, you know the rule.   
Accept the invite, stay the night.   
   
Hello, Yertle.    
 Oh. Oh, my God.   
I-I'll be on the next plane.   
Oh.   
What's wrong, honey?   
My Aunt Eunice is dying.   
I have to leave right away.   
Oh, poor Marge.   
Wait. She said "I," not "we."   
I don't have to go.   
   
   
Aw, you love her, too.   
   
Sweetie, do you want to come?   
Uh, uh, w-with all my heart.   
Uh, but the children need me.   
   
 Oh.   
   
Y'ello.   
Dad, I am begging you.   
Who is this?   
Okay.   
I made a loaf of peanut butter and jelly.   
You just have to slice it into sandwiches every day.   
- Check.
- I set the Roomba up to cope with your cleaning.   
   
- Check.
- I made a welcome wagon basket for our new neighbors from Eastern Europe.   
- Check.
- Not Czech, Slovenian.   
- Check.

One last thing... this is very important, Homer.   
The new season of Odder Stuff drops on Netflix tonight.   
Ooh, ooh. Something to do.   
Do not watch it without me.   
What? Why not? I have to see if my fan theories are correct.   
I think it's set in the '  s.   
- 
- Homer, the nine hours we binge watch that show together is our thing.   
And we don't have a lot of things.   
But holding hands in a darkened room with my head on your shoulder has become the glue that seals our love.   
I get it. I totally get it.   
I know I'm not perfect.   
Sometimes I forget our marriage birthday.   
- Our anniversary?
- Yes.   
And sometimes I forget your birth anniversary, but I promise I will not watch our show without you.   
Thank you, Homie.   
Thank you girls for coming.   
Dearest, you were always our favorite aunt.   
Psst, over here.   
When she's gone, I get the P's, Selma gets the S's.   
You get to notify the utilities.   
Can't this wait until after she's dead?   
I'll be too busy grieving.   
Yeah. Too busy grieving I got the salt shaker.    
Easy-peasy.
"P" for salt, "S" for pepper.   
I'm walking towards a light...   
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh. 
with a Post-it on it.    
Uh-oh.   
Okay, sweetie, here's a book that can help you fall asleep.   
No, no, no. No, sweetie.   
You chew it, like this. Look.   
   
Yummy book. Mmm.   
Oh.    
Hey.    
   
- 
-    
Hey, what?    
Huh.    
What's this? What are you doing?!    
You guys can't watch this.    
Uh, no. You can't watch this.    
We didn't promise Mom nothing.    
    
Children, there are     shows you could watch right now.    
Many with Ted Danson.    
    
- 
-     
Wait for me.    
    
This show you can watch.    
Too depressing.    
    
    
Oh. Ah! No.    
Must find place to avoid pop culture discussions.    
I know. The watercooler.    
- the Semi-Gorgon.
- so many twists.    
- I know.
- set in the '  s.    
And the Guffer Brothers.    
My turn to talk about how much I liked it.    
Shouldn't doing something nice for your wife feel better than this?    
Homer, will you read my Odder Stuff fan fiction?    
I threw it over Stephen King's fence but i-it hit him on the head.    
Why Stephen King?    
Eh, he's got a low fence.    
Mmm...    
    
Don't worry, kids.    
Sideshow Mel will be fine.    
He has an air bubble.    
It's all carbon dioxide now!    
    
    
 This is the last time I buy a trick from a magician's widow.    
Nobody's watching my show.    
What with the downloading and the streaming, and the fact that everything else is better.    
Now, you're my writers!    
You pay us like interns.    
And I'm your niece.    
- Hey-hey.
- Hey-hey.    
Now I want ideas.    
Why don't we do another live special?    
What? I can't remember lines.    
At my last wedding I wrote "I do" on the rabbi's forehead.    
You could hide a golden ticket in some candy like Willy Wonka.    
The only children allowed in my factory are the ones that work there.    
- How 'bout we have a contest?
-     
Some lucky kid gets to run around a Krusty store for five whole minutes and take all the toys they want.    
It inspires buying, it's easy to promote, and it's the third thing someone pitched.    
I'm sold!    
    
Let's see what else Netflix has to offer.    
"Because you watched an '  s show featuring a monster..."    
Alf, Roseanne, Moonlighting, The Cosby Show...    
They're all too scary.    
Ooh.  God forgive me.

Homer, I'm Ted Sarandos.    
Chief Content Officer of Netflix.    
    
This can't be a dream because I don't know who you are.    
I'm not a dream. Let's just say I'm a manifestation of complex algorithms that know everything about you.    
Well, I can't watch this because...    
I know. I know. Marge told you not to.    
Do you know that she's been watching Scandinavian crime dramas with full nudity without you?    
That nudity is story-driven.    
Yeah, right.    
But Odder Stuff is our thing.    
No. Your thing's with us.    
She's just along for the ride.    
The account's in your name.    
Come on, come on, watch it now.    
Because our subscription prices will triple tomorrow.    
    
Wow. I finally finished something I wasn't supposed to start.    
That is impressive.    
I won't even mind watching it again with...    
Homer?!
- Uh-oh.    
The lady from my marriage.    
My aunt recovered.    
  a.m.?    
Still warm.    
You watched it.    
I finally learn how little I mean to you.    
- Wait.
-     
No.    
Marge, I am sorry.    
Come on, it's a stupid TV show.    
I don't want to hear your voice.    
Mmm...    
No. We're staying married.    
Enough with the rebuses.    
All right, I'll just grab my pillow and sleep on the couch.

Perfect. And the best thing is I'm stealing it from you.

♪    
You cheated on your wife, Homer.    
I waited for Lenny before I watched.    
    
After this, we've got a stand-up special from Chris Rock.    
Don't watch that with your wife, either.    
    
    
    
Quit sleeping in the garden!

- Huh?    
Sweetie, everything's fine.    
Dad, maybe you should be talking to someone who's older than me.    
Ted Sarandos?    
Who's Ted Sarandos?    
I was hoping you knew.    
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.    
My son, what are your sins?    
Aside from thinking our church has confession.    
I watched a binge-worthy TV show without my wife.    
Was it The Crown?Don't tell me how it ends.    
Doesn't she become queen?    
Oh, go to Hell.    
Aw, what am I gonna do?    
I don't know what she wants!    
Homer, sorry to blow my own horn...    
    
but Netflix knows your wife better than you do.    
Do you know what she watches incessantly when you're not around?    
Usually this thing.
