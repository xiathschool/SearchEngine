Barn, thanks for picking up the money for me.
Now, what should I buy first?
h*tler's baseball?
A mirror that gives me advice?
My advice is to buy h*tler's baseball.
Wait a minute, homer!
You can't spend any of that money Or marge will know you lied.
Oh, yeah.
Marge, what are you doing?
The laundry.
The machine's on the fritz, And we can't afford the $400 to fix it.
Here I am a millionaire, And I can't even help the woman who gave birth to me.
Why don't you just buy things your family needs, And leave them where they'll find them?
Oh, barney, that's brilliant!
Just for that, you can help yourself To anything from this tree.
That's not the money tree.
I know.
It's where I hide my adult magazines.
Ooh...!

You'd think it'd be dishwasher safe, But it wasn't.
Why would you put it in the dishwasher?
You ruined it on purpose.
You want the old folks to be zombies, Because it makes your jobs easier!
Ooh, excuse us.
We tried to make the worst job in the world easier.
Well, I agree it's not the most pleasant job in the world...
Don't forget the low pay and the constant presence of death.
Well, you still should have let them have their fun!
They should've had their fun before they got here.
Who's ready for panini?
Up-- that's my chair, boy.
No problem.
I'll just sit here, closer to mom's ear.
Mom, how do you think we really got that panini press?
I thought the government sent it to us As part of the stimulus package.
At least that's what the letter said.
Well, actually, mom...
Uh! On second thought, boy, Why don't you take my chair?
So, bart, how's your big school presentation coming along?
Oh, great, now that dad's gonna star in it.
I agreed to no such thing!
Mom...

Of course.
Homer, I need you to rickshaw me to soccer practice. fine.
Let me just get my harness pads.
No time.
Boy, this has gone too far!
I quit!
Soon as I finish these oats.
Hey, hey, hey.
Let's not get crazy.
If you quit, I'm telling mom everything.
Not if I tell her first.
Now how am I supposed to get to soccer practice?
Hey, milhouse, want a turn pulling my rickshaw?
Okay, but just 'cause I'm your best friend, Don't be afraid to use that whip.
Okay, I'm taking off the blindfold.
Surprised?
Well, I kind of got a clue When I heard that "ballooning safety" video.
Marge, soaring above the forgiving beauty of nature, I have something to confess.
Um... I wasn't there for that wedding toast Because I was buying a lottery ticket.
You were what?!
You have a right to be angry. Furious!
And even though that ticket won a million dollars...
We've got a million dollars?!
Screw the toast!
Uh, yes, well, um...
Taxes took out a lot, I spent a ton on those things for the family, And, um, I didn't know you could rent a balloon. so we're right back Where we used to be.
Yes, but I have one more thing to show you.
Oh... My... God!
Marge, those groves of cherry blossoms Will bloom every year, To remind the world of the sweetest, Most forgiving woman who ever lived.
