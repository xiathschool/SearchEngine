Mmm. Who knew that Lee Marvin could do such marvelous splits?

Very well. We will now hear suggestions for the, uh... disbursement of the, uh, two million dollars.
Don't you mean three million dollars?
Of course. How silly of me.
You know, a town with money's a little like the mule with a spinning wheel.
No one knows how he got it, and danged if he knows how to use it.
 Mule.
The name's Lanley, Lyle Lanley... and I come before you good people tonight with an idea.
Probably the greatest- Ah, it's not for you.
It's more of a Shelbyville idea.
Now wait just a minute.
We're twice as smart as the people of Shelbyville.
Just tell us your idea, and we'll vote for it.
All right. I tell you what I'll do.
I'll show you my idea.
I give you the Springfield Monorail!
I've sold monorails to Brockway, Ogdenville and North Haverbrook... and by gum, it put them on the map!
Well, sir, there's nothir on earth like a genuine, bona fide... electrified, six-car monorail.
