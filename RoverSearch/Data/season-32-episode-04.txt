The temporal loop is simultaneously the most ambitious and laziest of the science fiction tropes.    
Now, let me look at my black mirror.    
That's not a reference.    
It's just, uh... It's filthy.    
Uh-huh. So, how do we break the cycle?    
I can tell you what you seek to know, but my price is...    
One breakfast burrito, all yolk, double bacon.    
 How did you...    
Because this isn't the first time we've come to you.    
We've given you     burritos.    
Wait, well, let's make it a round thousand, shall we?    
All right. Here you go.    
Temporal loops are broken by being nice in Groundhog Day, saving the whales in Star Trek IV, saying "Orange you glad I didn't say 'banana'?" in the knock-knock joke.    
And in the case of the movie Edge of Tomorrow, it was stopped by poor box office.    
I suspect Tom Cruise fatigue.    
Very... very deadly.    
But we've tried all those.    
I know this. You two must each use your special powers to help the other, like Superman and Batman.    
Okay. I've got it.

Or we could just k*ll Gil.    
  -degree angle!    
    
    
 We're alive.    
The loop is broken!    
So, I guess we go back to the way things were.    
I'll miss you.    
Thank you, Nelson.    
You helped me be okay with turning nine.    
Once I get out of this loop,

And, as usual, I've learned nothing!

Mom, I learned somethingreally important.    
No day is ever perfect, so just enjoy the day that you have.    
Happy birthday, Lisa!    
 I'm finally nine!    
And the universe is back to normal.    
 Now I can watch the food go in and out.
