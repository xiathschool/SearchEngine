Congratulations, sir...
it's eight puppies.   
Four boys, three girls, and, uh,   
one who would prefer
not to be labeled yet.   
Excellent, eight purebred puppies   
descended from the first litter   
of Karl Friedrich Dobermann himself.   
Smithers,
you're in charge of their training.   
Teach them all the classic commands.   
Sit, stay...   
and bite striking workers
with your "wittle teefers."   
Yes, Mr. Burns.   
And you've allowed the training dummies   
to fall into terrible disrepair.   
So I've ordered a new one.   
Here he is now.   
Um, I was told there'd be a taco truck?   
Don't worry,
their adult teeth haven't come in yet.   
Just look out for their
much sharper baby teeth.

- Hmm. Hmm.   
   
Ah, I guess
"Executive Kennel Supervisor"   
is all I'll ever be to Mr. Burns.   
Nothing... ow... worse... ow...

Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow.    
Ow. Ow. Ow.   
- Ow.
- Aw!

Ah, the puppies are finally   
m*rder enough to be doled out   
to my rich and powerful
allies who need watchdogs.   
Now to look through the pile of bribes   
and see who's begging hard
enough to earn a puppy.   
Warren Buffett sent this
box of broken wooden pieces.   
Sir, that's a puzzle.   
 It certainly is a puzzle.   
What's his game,
sending me these misshapen bits?   
Uh, well,
it's an activity people do for fun.   
With their friends.
Perhaps you and I could...   
Perhaps you could stop
assuming familiarity   
with your betters.   
Now g*n the puppies' eyes!   
   
   
Oh, if only I'd been born
in a litter of puppies,   
then maybe someone would love me.   
 Simpson!   
   
Come on, Mr. Smithers,
you don't have to be lonely.   
You've totally got it going on.   
You've got that bow
tie and those glasses   
and that hunky nasal voice.   
Oh, sadly,
the Springfield dating pool is   
pretty bleak.   
It's always guys who
don't want to commit,   
or straight guys who are
going through a phase.   
Disco Stu is   
hetero-flexible. Ooh!   
 I just want someone
to be there when I get home.   
Someone who loves me unconditionally.   
Oh, yeah, that's the good stuff.   
It's the conditions that'll k*ll ya.   
Mr. Smithers,
I'm gonna find you a man-Marge.   
Look at this guy... he seems perfect!   
That's me.   
Oh, yeah.
Well, it is a much younger picture.   
Goodbye. Thank you for the oil.   
I love it.   
Excellent.   
Well, that's the last of the litter.   
Oh, except for you.   
You're no k*ll, with those soft eyes   
and kind disposition.   
You've brought shame to the
very notion of inbreeding.   
Go on, bite him.   
Bite his doughy face.   
   
Who's gonna take you home?   
I hope they find you a dictator   
who's as sweet as you are.   
Or... how about
a Fortune     fashion designer   
who's already made a
matching suit for the puppy?   
Good muscle tone, needy,
with a slight drooling problem.   
Reminds me of my last boyfriend.   
His last girlfriend was a boy?   
Your last girlfriend was a boy?    
    
    
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just...    
Negotiating the sale of
excess Kilowatt hours    
to a Chinese server farm.    
- And you got a very good deal.
- Mm.    
I also speak Mandarin.
I'm Michael de Graaf,    
and I flew here from my villa
in Milan to claim this puppy.    
I can offer Burns a priceless
Impressionist painting.    
Mr. Burns' collection
could use a Manet...    
Well, I've got a Monet and a
guy who can change O's to A's.    
Mm, Mr. Burns would never
know the difference.    
He hates art...
he just wants to keep it out of museums.    
But first I told him
you have some questions    
about what the puppy's
looking for in a companion.    
Well, uh, this is an unusual Dobermann.    
Uh, are you prepared
for a dog that's sweet,    
maybe a little shy,
but just wants to give his heart    
to someone who loves him?    
He sounds like a dream come true.    
Okay, the puppy's yours, Mr. de Graaf.    
Please, it's Michael.    
This calls for a celebration.    
Are you free for dinner tonight?    
I'm sorry?    
You're talented, smart as a whip,    
and hot in a     s Cape
Canaveral kind of way.    
I'd love to take you on a date.

Aw. Mwah.    
Young lady,
I like your quirky fashion sense.    
That zigzag dress hem is everything.    
Thanks, but I don't really
pay attention to fashion.    
It doesn't seem... super important.    
I'd like to suggest some alterations.
May I?    
I mean, it's a waste of your time,
but fine.    
Wearing the same thing
every day is a choice,

think about important things,    
rather than "Am I on trend?"
