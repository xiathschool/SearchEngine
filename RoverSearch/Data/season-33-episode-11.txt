Shut up! It's starting!  
The Springfield Atoms have earned  
the number-one pick
in this year's draft,  
after intentionally losing
every game last season.  
Nobody t*nk like Springfield...  
City of Intentional Losers.   
t*nk! t*nk! t*nk!   
- And with the first pick
-    
of the draft,
the Springfield Atoms select...   
Grayson Mathers.   
   
All right!   
Yeah! All right!   
   
We have witnessed the most
beautiful birth in the world...   
that of a football dynasty.   
Let's show Philadelphia what a
real victory riot looks like!   
   
   
   
What a needless tragedy.   
You say our corporate revenue is down?   
Well, the losses are all
coming from one division...   
your liquor company.   
Sales of Mr. Gentleman Brandy   
have reached zero and are
only projected to go down.   
Impossible.   
Mr. Gentleman is sipped by every trustee   
of the Narragansett Whale Oil Concern.   
Well, maybe the problem
is the ad campaign.   
It's encouraging consuming   
as little of the liquor as possible.   
Ah. That'll hold me for quite a while.   
So, I brought in a branding expert   
to reimagine Mr. Gentleman.   
These days,   
which in the branding business
is called "the present,"   
the only liquor brands people care about   
are endorsed by big celebrities.   
People think, "If I buy this tequila,   
then I'm as fun as George Clooney."   
Or, "I need to be
more smug and unbearable.   
 Hey, Ryan Reynolds has a gin."   
So we find the perfect celebrity
to represent my brandy.   
But who?   
What about Harrison Ford?   
- Too Hollywood.
- Dolly Parton?   
- Too Dollywood.
- With that, we end the list   
of every celebrity who
does not already have   
an existing liquor company.   
So what we need is
a brand-new celebrity,   
one adored by the common man.   
Grayson Mathers!   
Grayson Mathers! Grayson Mathers!   
Grayson!   
Grayson, some have dubbed you   
"The Savior of Springfield Football".   
Isn't that a lot of
pressure for a rookie?   
I do me.   
If you don't like it, that's on you.   
Mm-hmm.   
Grayson,
some people are put off   
by your tell-it-like-it-is attitude.   
What do you say to them?   
I'm an open book,   
but the media and haters   
and people who have
never played the game,   
I carry myself with
a certain confidence,   
and I don't apologize
for your perception   
of statements I did not make,
but stand by.   
Truth b*mb.   
I sleep at night.   
What did you just say?   
I do me.   
   
Man, that dude keeps it so real.   
He's all, "This is me.   
I don't apologize. What up, haters?"   
He does him.   
I wish I was half as myself as he is.   
They adore this pigskin-tossing
football thrower.   
He's brash, outspoken,   
willfully uninformed.   
He has no filter.   
In our sanitized, clickbait-ready,   
media-driven world,   
what people crave is authenticity.   
If you don't believe me,
look at the metrics.   
Now you believe me.   
Why didn't you mention
any of this before?   
I don't know.   
This bad boy must be the new
face of my brandy company.   
Smithers, hire him at once.   
And get rid of this.   
But my metrics!   
    
I got no problem being me.    
Opinions exist.    
Think about it.    
Do you seriously doubt
I know what I'm like?    
And when it comes to brandy,    
go ahead and sip.    
Me?    
I'll chug.    
I do me.    
You do you...    
my way.    
Congratulations, my boy.    
You are the face of America's
most marked-up trash liquor.    
There's one thing that's
unique about me...    
I've always admired rich people.    
And now I'm getting paid by one.    
That's on you.    
Aw, come on, Burnsy.    
Bring it in.    
Yeah. I got you, bro.    
♪ ♪    
So this is what it feels
like to be brought in.    
Cheers!    
To the money that comes from business.    
To friendship hugs.    
 Well,    
first game of the season tomorrow,    
so I'd better hit the Hay.    
That's the name of
the club I'm going to.    
Then I'm gonna hit the Sack.    
That's where the after-party is.    
There he is, kids.    
The QB who will one day
take us to the Super Bowl,    
own several local car dealerships    
and host a middling Saturday Night Live.    
Oh, look at that baby face.    
I hope there's no tackling today.    
Babyface looks a little hungover, Mom.    
Geez. He's kind of got    
that "Dad asleep in his car
outside Moe's" look going.    
The icy stare of a born winner?    
Yes. That one.    
And so begins a new
era in Atoms football.    
The golden child's mighty arm    
shall spiral a grim warning
to all who would oppose him.    
Hut, hut! Hike!    
    
    
    
Oh, God.    
    
- Get off the field!
- Boo! - You suck!    
Oh, my God.    
The   -year-old I bet
all my happiness on    
is nothing but a bust!    
Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust!    
But you were just cheering for him.    
You've been talking
about how great he is    
every day for months.    
But he's sucking.    
It's the second-best thing he could do    
next to playing great.    
    
How dare they jeer that boy?    
He's like the arrogant,
out-of-control son    
I never sent to boarding
school and forgot about.

There are far worse
things to be buried under.    
Launch the souvenir loaded nachos!    
Ah. Nothing like a nice
body-temperature bath.    
I've never been booed before.    
Not even when I trolled
the Florida State fans    
by dancing on their coach.    
Am I, like, a loser now?    
If I am a loser,    
then maybe I shouldn't be...

You supply the nurturing home life,

It's a deal.    
You're coming home with me.    
I really want to,

I'll call them and
tell them you're sick.    
Yo. Two parents and some kids?    
This is a straight-up family.    
For real.    
I guess we are.    
So, Grayson,
you just graduated from college, right?    
What did you major in?    
Oh, they never told me.    
 That means communications.    
You see, I grew up
on the Florida-Texas border,    
where football is king.    
One day, I saw this other
baby crawling a post pattern,    
and I hit him with my pacifier.    
Perfect spiral.    yards.    
My folks did what any
loving parents would do...    
they packed me off to football academy.    
I'm real grateful.    
If you keep a kid at home till he's two,    
it can screw up his development.    
Growing up in an
all-football environment    
helped me avoid the distractions
that come with being a kid...    
friends, laughing, that junk.    
For college,
Alabama Tech was an easy choice.    
Coach is an amazing recruiter.    
You really feel his passion.    
Wait, so you never see your parents?    
Oh, I see them all the time!    
I see them at games,    
in documentaries about me,    
in the Campbell's Soup commercial    
my mom did without my knowledge.    
Oh, Grayson,    
growing up with nothing but football    
can't have been healthy.    
 No, no, I'm good.    
Gimme that back!    
Starters eat before scrubs!    
Everybody knows that!    
    
    
    
You know, I'm beginning to
see the appeal of football.

In a family, we do not steal food.

In a family, you don't do you.
