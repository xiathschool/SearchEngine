Breakfast!
Breakfast? 
 Cereal?
You know I like my breakfast fried or chicken-fried.
It's a healthy cereal from Europe. Müeslix!
They also make Juice-lix.
That's Milhouse.
And it sounds like he has big news!
Yech!
I'll get us out of this. Say, Dad.
Wanna go see my project for the school science fair?
No, Lisa.
But I sure don't wanna eat this crappy breakfast.
Meet Linguo, the grammar robot. I built him all by myself.
If you misuse language, he'll correct you.
Well, let's put him to the test.
Me love beer.
I love beer.
Oh, he loves beer. Here, little fella.
Dad, no!
Error.
I'm sorry. I thought he was a party robot.
Oh! This is why I can't have nice things.
 Every time I design a robot, somebody comes along and-
♪ 
Ooh! Can I have a brownie?
They're for after dinner.
Ooh! Can I have dinner?
You can't have a brownie, period.
Homer wants a brownie. I'm gonna get one.
No.
Coming in from the left.
Stop it.
Or is it the right? Look out for the reach-around!
Homer!
He sh**t, he sc-  My thumb!
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!
 Sorry doesn't put thumbs on the hand, Marge!
Well, calm down. If we hurry, they can reattach your thumb.
Reattach a thumb? This isn't Gattaca!
We've just gotta get your thumb to the-
Where did it go?
Okay, boy. Drop the thumb.
Nobody's gonna tackle you. 
D'oh! Come back with my thumb!
9-1-1. This better be good.
I cut off my husband's thumb.
Attempted m*rder?
You'll burn for this- burn in jail!
It was an accident!
Yeah, yeah. Save it for Dateline Tuesday.
Uh, what's your address so I can come arrest you?
Arrest me? Um, my address... it's, um, 123 Fake Street.
123 Fake Street. Got it.
Come on! Come on, boy.
Oh, please give it back!
You want people food? I can get you people food.
Oh!
I have nothing he wants!
And Harry Potter and all his wizard friends... went straight to hell for practicing witchcraft.
Yea!
What the diddlio?
Give me back my thumb!
We've gotta get to the hospital, Homer!
Okay. If the doctor asks why you cut it off... you caught me in bed with four beautiful women.
Let's just say that Bart did it.
Oh, doodlebugs.
My Ferrari! I had to do awful things to pay for her.
Homer, help!
 Marge! Over here!
I'm sorry, Homer. Your H.M.O. Doesn't cover this type of injury.
But I have finger insurance!
A thumb is not a finger.
Isn't there anything you can do?
Well, I could cut off the other thumb for a sense of symmetry.
Symmetry, eh?
Hibbert's really losing it. We're going to Dr. Nick's.
We need more ice. My thumb is fading fast!
Quick! Moe, Marge cut off my thumb!
No problem. Just stick the old eye gouger in the pickle brine.
That'll keep your thumb fresh and delicious.
Thanks, Moe.
Hey, ain't you gonna have a beer?
Well, I really shouldn't, what with my massive bl*od loss and all.
Although I do like the occasional beer.
Did you ever see that Blue Man Group?
Total rip-off of the Smurfs.
And the Smurfs- They suck!
 Uh-oh. I smell gangrene.
We gotta wake him up.
A little coffee'll do the trick.
 What?
I gotta get to Dr. Nick's!
Where's Marge? Oh, that is so rude.
Oh! I know. I'll hitchhike!
Oh, why isn't this working?
♪ 
Hey, thanks for stopping.
T'ain't nothin'.
You and me share a common infirmity.
If anyone ever tells you a hog won't eat a finger, they's lyin'.
Oh, crap! It's on fire!
Inflammable means flammable? What a country!
Can you drive me to Shelbyville Hospital?
I reckon so. Hey!
Somebody done "stolded" my wheels!
Thanks a lot. Now I gotta walk to Shelbyville.
 It's too late.
Well, old friend, we always knew this day would come.
Say good-bye to your brother.
What the hell!
 Linguo... dead?
Linguo...
is... dead.

I'm sorry. I thought he was a party robot.
Oh! This is why I can't have nice things!
Every time I design a robot, somebody comes along and-
Hang on, Linguo. You'll be up and conjugating in no time.
 My thumb!
Quiet, please. Some of us are trying to weld.
Almost done. Just lay still.
Lie still.
I knew that. Just testing.
Sentence fragment.
"Sentence fragment" is also a sentence fragment.
Must conserve battery power.
Just come on.
Uh-oh! The bus!
Hey, stop! Wait!
Oh! Any day but science project day!
Kiss first place good-bye, Lisa!
Oh, no!
Somebody took my bike! 
Mom, I need a ride to school!
We gotta get to the hospital, Homer!
Idiot! You almost ran over a viewer!
And she's in our key demo! Sorry about that, kid. Need a ride?
Can you take me to school, Krusty?
Hop in.
Hey, moron. Springfield Elementary, and step on it.
Hey, Teeny, you know where 123 Fake Street is?
Ah, it's okay. Hey, we got the same hat.
Thanks, Mr. Teeny.
Wha-
Huh? This isn't Miss Hoover's class.
I do not know this Mademoiselle Hoover of which you speak.
What's happening? Where am I?
Sacre bleu! What a foolish question!
You are at West Springfield Elementary School.
West Springfield?
I'm at the wrong school!
En Français.
 Sorry.
I was rushing because I'm in the wrong school.
 Can you believe that?
It's understandable. All the schools in this area were built from identical plans.
I guess they didn't have enough money to hire I.M. Pei.
Oh. You know about I.M. Pei?
I am impressed.
My name's Thelonious.
As in Monk?
Yes. The esoteric appeal is worth the b*at.
What do your friends call you?
I don't really have any friends.
 Just like me!
♪ 
Oh, my God!
15! We've been spinning for hours.
I've got to get to my school and hand in Linguo.
Oh, but I don't want to leave you.
You must. You can't sacrifice grades for romance.
That's not the girl I fell for.
Will I ever see you again?
Of course you will... at the magnet high school. Now, go.
Hmm. It's noon.
That's about when Dad gets the brew shakes.
My dad's not here? I need a ride to school!
Yeah, yeah. We all got problems.
Chief Wiggum, can you drive me to school? It's an emergency!
No can do, doll face. I got an informant wearing a wire.
 Just like on Nash Bridges.
We're trying to get the goods on some smugglers.
 Why, I'd be delighted to sell you some illegally smuggled goods.
That sounds like Fat Tony.
Only one way to be sure.
Fat Tony, is that you? Fat Tony?
Hey, where's that voice coming from?
 This guy's wearing a wire!
 Take him out!
My bad. I can't work my answering machine either.
 Now I need a new informant.
Say, Lisa, people trust you. How would you like to be a snitch?
The pay stinks, but-
Oh.
Quick! Moe, Marge cut off my thumb!
Lisa!
Mom, where'd you get that car?
I stole it from McBain after I cut off your father's thumb.
Can you take me to school, please?
Not right now. Your father's in there, and-
Did you ever see that Blue Man Group?
Oh, he's on the Blue Man Group again.
Come on. We've got lots of time.
Oh, no!
We're out of gas. I couldn't figure out this stupid ltalian gas gauge.
I've gotta get to school!
♪ 
Hmm. Let's hitch a ride with that hick.
Abracathumbra!
Dang! You could be one of them TV magic queers.
Shoo!
00!
Well, I've already borrowed one car. Let's go!
Somebody done "stolded" my wheels.
Thanks a lot! Now I gotta walk to Shelbyville.
There's the school!
First place, here I come.
 Look out!
Bart!
Son of a diddly!
Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Hey, hey!
Lazy, eh? Get him, boys!
♪ 
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
Okay, okay!
Breakfast!
That's Milhouse.
And it sounds like he has big news!
I found something awesome in the woods!
Is it a dead body?
It's cooler than a million dead bodies!
You take my sister's bike.
Let's see. Front door. Back door.
Skinner's. Flanders'. Your house.
Ah! Lisa's bike.
What's it like riding a girl's bike?
It's disturbingly comfortable.
Whoa! How'd you find it?
This is where I come to cry.
Cool.
Wow! Sacks!
Burlap sacks!
It gets better. They're full of fireworks!
Bottle rockets, frog launchers, Weeping Mamas.
Tijuana Toilet Crackers!
Three, two, one. Gnomes, blow up.
We're not ready!
Uh-oh.
So what are we doing, a lengthening or a widening?
Yarr. Uh, let's make it both.
Garr!
Don't worry. It's inflammable.
Let's keep this our little secret.
We gotta hide!
We'll be safe in here.
Here we are. 123 Fake Street.
The home of kn*fe Wifey.
Hey, Chief, can I hold my g*n sideways? It looks so cool.
 Ah, sure.
Whatever you want, birthday boy.
Okay, drop the kn*fe, Stabitha!
Great grilled-cheese ghost!
We've uncovered a hard-core cracker house.
There's enough Chinese sky candy here... to put you boys away for a long time.
I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency!
Yeah. They'll pass you around like-
Well, like currency, like you said.
Maybe we can make you boys a deal.
Your mission is to find the fireworks smugglers... and get them to say something incriminating on this tape.
"Hootie and the Blowfish"?
Yeah. It's cheaper than blank tape.
Great idea to smuggle fireworks, boss.
Yeah, I was gettin' sick of running those unions.
So much paperwork.
Knock-knock. Excuse me.
My friend and I were interested in purchasing quality fireworks.
Yes, we are.
Why, I'd be delighted to sell you some illegally smuggled goods.
 Fat Tony, is that you? Fat Tony?
Hey, where's that voice coming from?
This guy's wearin' a wire!
Take him out!
Whoa!
 My bad.
Hey, there they are!
Gentlemen, remove your g*n from your holsters.
Shoulder or ankle?
Surprise me.
Milhouse, quick!
 Look out!
Bart!
Ow! Mom!
 Hurry up, Bart!
You ain't goin' nowhere!
You leave those boys alone!
Hey, they's throwin' robots!
They are throwing robots.
He's disrespecting us. Shutuppayouface!
Shut up your face.
What's-a matta, you?
You ain't so big.
Me and him are gonna whack you in the labonza!
 Bad grammar overload!
Error! Error!
What the hell!
 Linguo... dead?
It's all right, boys.
Oh, thank goodness everyone's okay.
Except your thumb, and Lisa's science project.
I couldn't help but notice your respective predicaments.
Perhaps I may offer a bipartite solution.
There you go. Enjoy your thumb.
As the circulation returns... the subject prepares for a long and painful recovery.
It's lucky for me that Legs was an experienced Mob doctor.
He once pulled a slug out of my arm and inserted it into a stoolie's brain.
That's a first place science project, Lisa.
Boy, this sure was one crazy day.
Right, Mr. Teeny?
 En Français.
