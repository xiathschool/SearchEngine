Welcome back to Great Moments in Olympic History.
At the 1936 Berlin Games, Jesse Owens humiliates Adolph h*tler... by outracing his zeppelin.
1968, Mexico City.
Bob Beamon shatters the world long jump record.
Ow!
And in 1984, Portugal's Carlos Lopez... becomes the oldest Olympic marathon winner ever... at age 38.
 Thirty-eight! That's roughly my age.
Marge, after a lot of thought...
I've decided to run the Springfield Marathon.
Oh, please. You get exhausted watching The Twilight Zone marathon.
 I'm a regular Billy Crystal.
You got that right.
Well, Dad, I think running's good exercise.
It adds years to your life.
Stay out of this, Lisa.
Marge, I've made up my mind. I'll do your job for a day, and you do mine.
Then we'll see who has it tougher.
Good afternoon. And welcome to the 97th Springfield Marathon... commemorating the time Jebediah Springfield... ran across six states to avoid his creditors.
You got all your equipment, Dad?
Let's see. Sweatbands, check.
Anti-chafing nipple tape, check, check, and check.
Attention, runners. On your mark, get set... now get outta here before I change my mind.
 I can't believe it. I'm actually running a marathon!
 I hit the wall! This is so painful.
Hey, I got my second wind! 
Another wall! I just- Whoo-hoo! Third wind.
Faster, rickshaw driver! Faster!
Ow!
Sir, the whip isn't helping.
Silence!
You call yourself Chinese?
No one can outrun The Flash! 
Curses! One of my super foes has set a trap for me.
Hey, Grampa's running!
That's not Grampa. Dad's just dehydrated.
 And with 500 yards to go... the runners from Australia and Djibouti are neck and neck.
Two weary warriors now burning with pain and exhaustion.
A walking tour of Springfield.
 That tour is mine.
Well, hold the phone, Dora.
A new challenger has emerged out of nowhere.
He's running on sheer pluck, moxie and grit.
All of which he'll be tested for after the race.
Hey, I "winna" the race! Viva ltalia!
Folks, our winner seems to be from ltaly.
I love-a you all.
I use up all of my English.
♪ 
Grazie, Springfield!
He's a phony!
Lousy cheater!
I demand a re-race!
I got a better idea. Let's have a fun run... on his trachea.
Yeah!
k*ll him!
Make him pay!
Get in. Hurry!
Mob, stranger. Mob, stranger.
Stranger!
Who are you?
Oh, you'll find out in due time.
Well, it says here your name is L.T. Smash.
The time has come. I'm L.T. Smash.
Thank you so much for saving our son from that m*rder mob.
Well, thank you for letting me chill in your crib.
And thank you for assuming we're hip.
All right, now here's the 411. I'm a record producer, see?
I'm starting a new boy band. And there's a place in it for Bart.
My Bart?
Oh, yeah.
That stunt he pulled at the race shows me he's the bad boy I'm looking for.
Now listen to me, Smash.
We're not signing anything unless it's a contract.
Why do you want Bart? He's not much of a singer.
Marge, it's not the singing that brings in the Sacagaweas.
Bart's a rebel. And that's what I need for my new band, the Party Posse.
Now hold on. I have some concerns.
Please, Mom. My dream is to be a rock star!
And my dream is to get rid of Bart.
But-
How many lives must you ruin?
Oh, okay.
Bart, I want you to meet and greet the other members of the Party Posse.
He's smart, he's soulful...
he's Milhouse.
What up, "G" Money?
Next, he'll break your nose, your glasses and your heart.
Nelson.
Wait. These are just guys from school.
Who's next? Ralph Wiggum?
Whee! I'm a pop sensation.
And I'm the mack daddy behind such groups as...
New Kids in the Ditch and Boy-nudo.
I'm gonna make you stars.
♪ 
Sneer, sneer. Two, three, four, and thrust.
And grab yourself right there. Now let's go and flirt.
You call that a flirt? I'm not melting!
♪ 
Okay. 'Tudes are fly and your threads are dope.
All that's left is the singing.
"Party Posse, we rule the earth.
The greatest band since music's birth"?
Isn't this song a little boastful?
No one told me there was gonna be boasting.
Just take it from the top.

And now, are you adequately prepared to rock?
Silence!
Here they are, the Party Posse!
Hello, Springfield!
Now here's a song that your Principal Skinner doesn't want us to play.
 Boo!
That's not true. This assembly was my idea.
I like your brand of inoffensive pop rock.
Screw you, man! We're gonna play it anyway.

L.T., thank God you're here!
The government's putting subliminal messages in your videos!
Subliminal messages?
Do you have any idea how insane that sounds?
Is that a navy tattoo?
A navy tattoo?
Do you have any idea how insane that sounds?
Lieutenant Smash!
Yeah, that's right. Lieutenant L.T. Smash.
A wig! But- But your pant legs.
 How could you soil the good name of Star Blitzzz Promotions?
Oh, come on, Lisa. We've always used pop stars to recruit people.
Going back to Elvis. Then there was Sgt. Pepper's... the Captain & Tennille, and the Kiss army.
But you have recruiting ads on TV.
Why do you need subliminal messages?
It's a three-pronged attack.
Subliminal, liminal, and super liminal.
Super liminal?
I'll show you.
Hey, you! Join the navy!
Uh, yeah, all right.
I'm in.
Well, now that you know, Lisa...
I'm afraid I can't let you leave.
Oh.
Wait a minute. Bart's band is brainwashing kids... with subliminal messages?
That's pretty far-fetched, Lisa.
Are you sure someone hasn't been bitten by the jealousy bug?
 Here comes the jealousy bug!
Gonna get ya! Gonna get ya!
Hey! Stop!
Cut it out. You're a grown man.
 I want to go home now.
Nobody's going home!
We're going to see Bart's concert.
An aircraft carrier? Oh, that's subtle.
Good afternoon, and welcome to the U.S.S. Sea Spanker!

Huh? Oh, Admiral. Hup!
The hippie fantasy again?
They're getting less frequent, sir.
Excellent.
Well, there's no easy way to say this.
The new administration is shutting down Project Boy Band.
Shutting it down? Permission to say "that's crazy," sir?
You won't say it's crazy when you see next week's issue of Mad magazine.
Oh, dear God.
When this satirical b*mb hits the stands tomorrow... your band will have as much recruiting power as a wax apple.

Dad, L.T.'s gone crazy!
Yeah. That's the look. 
Think he's gonna do something dangerous?
How should I know? Just keep loading m*ssile.
Pop music's hard work.
The Statue of Liberty? Where are we?
All right, Posse, that's our target.
 Not Mad!
That's our nation's largest mental illness-themed humor magazine!
Why don't we call it "Everybody Hates Raymond?"
Well, we stayed up all night, but it was worth it.
We can't let L.T. Blow up Mad!
Tina Brown was just starting to turn it around.
We gotta mellow him out!
But how? We would need the ultimate chill-out song.
And fast!
♪ 
We heard what you said.
Yeah! Heard it old school.

Can the chitchat, Milhouse. We've got just the song you need to defuse this whack attack.
Defuse it old school.
'Bout time.
Radical!
Awesome!
I can't read.
I can't sing without dancing.
Fine!
Thrust, spin, turn. Pivot, pout, jiggy.
Jiggy, robot, do-si-do.
And close with a Matrix.
Nobody pouts going into a jiggy.
Yeah. That's stupid.
I want to twirl!
Aw, come on, guys. We've only got a few minutes. Uh-oh.
Everybody okay?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah. I'm fine. Thanks.
I actually feel better.
Well, boys, the Party Posse is over.
But at least I saved you from a public spoofing.
Aw, man. We could've been on the cover of Mad.
They called me "Smelson!" Ha-ha!
Smelson. It's funny 'cause you smell.
Smelson. I could've thought of that.
 Sure ya could've. Off ya go now.
You know, we've had a lot of fun tonight at the expense of the U.S. Navy.
But they're out there every day protecting us from Godzilla.
And don't forget pirates.
And jellyfish.
Those whack invertebrates will sting you, old school!
So check out the navy for a two- or a four-year hitch.
We signed J.C. Up yesterday.
