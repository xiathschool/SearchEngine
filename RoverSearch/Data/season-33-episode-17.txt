I can't believe they're

Why do you hate the lottery?
It's my retirement plan.   
Ugh. The lottery is a tax on people   
who can't calculate the
insanely low odds of winning   
because they went to
schools that are underfunded   
because of... guess what...
scams like the lottery.

- About what?
- About Bleeding Gums's music   
being misappropriated by the lottery.   
It happens all the time.   
America's only original art form
is stealing Black music.   
  
boycott the lottery.   
Shh. They're announcing
the lotto numbers.   
   
Six,   ,   
  ,   ...   
- 
- Oh, man. Come on.   
Let me tell you something, people.
One more number,   
and I'm a winner.   
If it happens,
that's the last you'll see of me.   
I despise this town,   
especially the death-stalking ghouls   
who watch local news.   
And the last number is...    
- 
-   . I lost.    
    
In other news, Kent Brockman's
"Hooray for Springfield!"    
 .    
Oh, I love this town.    
Just once,
I want to be one of those guys    
who wins the lottery and
blows it on a single binge    
that haunts him to his grave.    
    
Aw, what's wrong?    
A jazz god's work has
been misappropriated.    
But I'm gonna fix it.    
Come here, kid. This is important.    
Lisa, if you ever listen to
one thing I say, it's this:    
don't try to save anyone or anything.    
Please, please, do not waste your time    
chasing lost causes.    
The environment? It's over.    
Democracy? Hanging by a thread.    
Broadcast television?
Only losers still watch that.    
- 
-     
So promise me you won't waste time    
on this jazz dealy.    
You have my word.    
I won't waste any more
time on lost causes.    
Because time spent
on lost causes is never wasted.    
What did you just mutter?    
Something that undercut what I said.    
That's my girl.    
The Springfield Lottery has been accused    
of misappropriating a
revered musician's work.    
Tonight, because...     
...this crap station
is still stuck with me,    
I'm hosting a debate between the
state lottery and Lisa Simpson,    
who has anointed herself    
the world's foremost
Bleeding Gums Murphy expert.    
I'm still working on that name.    
But I can tell you    
he would not want his incredible music    
used for this carnival of greed
known as the lottery.    
- Little girl, you claim to know everything about Mr. Murphy.
- I do.    
- Do you even know his first name?
- Oscar.    
- Do you know his favorite key?
- B-flat.    
Mm, that's right.
Favorite brand of reed?    
Légère.    
Favorite type of jazz?    
- Straight-ahead.
- Huh.    
Do you know the name
of his first recording?    
Well, his first album wasBroken Elevator Blues.    
- Yes...
- But his first recording    
was at Minton's Playhouse    
playing alongside Thelonious Monk    
when Bleeding Gums was   .    
Hmm, right again.    
She'll know this. She'll know this.    
Aha. How old is his son?    
He has a son?    
- 
-     
I did not know that.    
No further questions, Your Honor.    
But this isn't a courtroom.    
Overruled.    
- We'll be right back.
-     
 I feel like a fool.    
How could I love someone so much    
and not know something
so important about him?    
Don't worry, Lisa.    
- To me, you're perfect.
- I am?    
Yes. But I'm just an image
created by your mind,    
so I say what you want.    
Oh, that's pleasant.    
Come on, Lis. Let's play Target Lisa.    
Sorry, I'm too sad.    
I can barely play the
soulless sounds of Kenny G.    
No one likes Kenny G.    
That's why they k*ll
Kenny A through F.    
I didn't even know my hero had a son.
    
Watching you cry makes
me feel the need to act.    
Ah, much better.    
I'm gonna find your son.    
And I'm gonna find out what he thinks    
about the way your songs are being used.    
Well, here's a clue. I named him
after my favorite piano player.    
Monk. M-Monk Murphy.    
That's right.
Now that you've got the name,    
just check the phone book.    
What's a phone book?    
I have been dead a long time.    
Hi. I'm Lisa Simpson.    
And you're Monk Murphy.    
Oh, my God.
You look just like your father.    
Let me guess.    
You're one of the
musicians my dad mentored.    
Do you want to come in
and see pictures of him?    
Well, I don't want
to impose on your time.    
- Okay.
- Oh, yes! Please, please, please.    
Let me just tell you, I loved your dad.    
For a blues musician,
he could really cheer people up.    
Just thinking about him makes me smile.
    
And I found out he recorded
a song just for you.    
"Monk's New Tune."    
♪ Before I
was saved by my better half ♪    
♪ I once disappeared ♪    
♪ In a black-and-white photograph. ♪    
Please, I'm sorry.    
That's not something I can enjoy.    
I understand. You miss your dad.    
I do. But I can't enjoy music    
because I can't hear it. Never could.    
I was born profoundly deaf.    
Oh. But this whole time we were talking,    
- you seemed to hear everything.
- I read lips.    
   
I'm your dad's biggest fan.    
 Did you love
him as much as I do?    
Yes. He was a great dad.    
He even refereed my soccer games.    
    
- 
- You know,    
his whole world was music and me.    
So he took it kind of hard    
when he found out that I couldn't hear.    
    
_    
This boy's hearing loss is so profound,    
you could fire a g*n
right next to his head,    
and he wouldn't hear it.    
That's not how you tested him, is it?    
Of course not.    
There have been great advancements,
though.    
With a cochlear implant    
combined with auditory
and language therapy,    
he could potentially hear quite well.    
But I have to warn you,
like any important medical miracle,    
it's only for rich people    
and doctors who get a huge discount.    
    
Son, I'm gonna work night and day    
to get you that cochlear implant.    
Uh, do you have any other
k*ll besides playing jazz?    
I also teach jazz.    
Uh, how are you paying
for this appointment?    
With this.    
Looks like about $  .    
Yeah. I had a good month.    
Wow. That must be when your father wrote    
"Sixteen Bucks Just Ain't Enough."    
Do you still want to get
the cochlear implant?    
I do. Very much.    
But I take after my dad.    
He played jazz for a living.
I run a nonprofit.    
I make a lot more than
he did but not enough.    
Wait. Did you know they're
using your dad's song    
for the Springfield Lottery?    
Oh, my God. What? But he hated gambling.    
I know. Did he tell you that?    
Uh, no. I learned it on the website,    
Bleeding Gummy Bears.    
Yes!
Finally nailed the title.    
But the lottery must
be giving you money.    
Enough for the implant. Right?    
Nope. I'm afraid
I haven't gotten any money.    
I'm sorry, what?
I was destined to find you.    
My new mission in life
is to make you happy.    
You're my new cause.    
Hold up. I'm not anybody's cause.    
I enjoy who I am. I love my community.    
And, you know, sometimes I like
turning off annoying sounds    
by just closing my eyes.    
Oh, yes. I hate annoying noises.    
Now just listen.
Here's what we're gonna do.    
We're gonna bring those
publishers to their knees.    
You and I are g...    
...gonna lawyer up, and I...    
Then, eventually,
the Supreme Court will hear...    
...going to restore your dad's legacy.    
Now? I have to eat.
I have a bl*od sugar thing.    
It's so much easier if you
don't work against me here.    
It's cool. They know me here.    
    
Mind if I open this window?    
This place has windows?    
 I'm home.    
Ooh, they put up a memorial wall.    
That's McCoy Tyner.
He played with Coltrane.    
Gerald Wilson,
the west coast Duke Ellington.    
And look, Sarah Vaughan.     
Oh, no. Etta Pryor passed?    
No, baby, I didn't.    
I am not gonna lean
against this wall anymore.    
Now scat.  No, no, no.
Baby, please.    
Not that kind of scatting.    
    
We just wanted some
information about my dad.    
Monk Murphy?     
Your dad used to bring you here
when you was just a baby.    
You know,
I wrote so many songs about you.    
Like, uh, um, um,
"Please Change the Baby's Diaper."    
"That Baby Spit Up on My Good Dress."    
And "Who Brings a Baby to a Jazz Club?"    
Now, that was a smash hit.    
Oh, it's so good to see you again.    
No one knew your dad better than me.    
I knew him better than his mama,    
his preacher and his supplier    
at the Sunglass Hut.    
Great. Who owns the rights to his music?

Ah, thanks. I work hard

Or handwriting. Or fingerprints.    
 Yeah.    
How could you sell Bleeding Gums's song    
to the lottery?
It belongs to him and his family.    
No, you're right.
Uh, Bleeding Gums wrote it.    
Then he came to us to distribute it.    
He should've read the
contract boilerplate,    
which we never showed him
nor told him actually existed.    
And, boy, is there a lot of boilerplate.    
But, uh, he got his share.    
"Worldwide royalties,    cents"?    
This is half of what they promised.    
This is the   st century, bub,

to release it for free    
on the Internet.
But we are gonna sue you.

Yes, Hoke.    
And teach me about
equality and civil rights    
in a way that doesn't
make me feel too guilty.    
In return, in    years,    
I will ask you your last name.    
Hey, whoa.
What are you doing?    
I was forming an unlikely friendship.    
Hey, me, too. Against how many odds?    
All.    
But I see you as so much more than that.    
It's your legacy I'm fighting for.    
And evil corporations can't
win against someone like me    
who has a big heart, gumption and...    
Oh, crap.    
I'm just a kid, this is real life,    
and there's only so much I can do.    
All right. I surrender to reality.    
Little Lisa,    
you're finally starting to understand    
what the blues is all about.    
    
Is this where Monk Murphy works?    
Yes. He's directing a
production of Richard III.    
I believe it's the first time
an eight-year-old deaf girl    
- has played that role.
- Wow. I am so there.
