Today's guest created a womens only gym... that's taken the tri-county area by storm.
Marge Simpson.
Marge, I thank you for creating Shapes... and uh my boyfriend thanks you too... when is Straightman going to pop the question? uh uh............. y'all getting german cuckoo clocks... you're getting a cuckoo clock... and you're getting a cuckoo clock... and you're getting a cuckoo clock... and you're getting a cuckoo clock.
Oh yeh Marge, I love these business trips of yours... the T.V. remote isn't nailed on... my whole life I've never been in a hotel that trusted me... hors d'oeuvres, big fancy desserts... and my wife is paying for everything... now I know why pimps are so happy... yep nothing b*at living on 'wife support'
I hear that... yo guys, come meet a new husband... hey how yo doin? I'm Homer... my wife invented a gym for 'regular women' my wife invested Sky Pills, she mixed vitamins with alka-seltzer... and pretended it was medicine.
I pay ten dollars a tube for those... that's why I drive a Bentley.
Yep. I haven't decided what kind of new car to get... you better decide soon as I have a feeling... your wife will also be getting a new model... yeh she'll be trading up... and they're not talking about cars... are you sure they're not talking about cars? because those are car words.
Homer, we're all second husbands... as soon as our wives hit it big they dumped the fat old guys... they were with and married us.
Marge won't dump me.
I'm the anchor that keeps her weighed down... here's how it starts... she gets a total make-over... then she starts wearing fancy new clothes... then she stops wanting to tell you about her day... here's how you know she's really about to go... your wife seems happy and full of life... that will never happen.
Marge. Marge. the makeover... oh my god the prophecy is being fulfilled... um so tell me about your day... oh you don't want to hear about my boring old day.
I do. I do. well the first inspirational speech of the day... was by the woman who climbed Mt Everest... and got everyone else k*ll. hey the networks are different channels in this city.
It's O.K. I don't care that you don't care... go watch your thing... are you happy and full of life.
I sure am.
Marge, now that you're rich... you really should get rid of that bag.
Really' but I'm so used to my old one.
Old one? They're convincing Marge to dump me.
Oh it's easy I get a new one every two years... from ltaly... you would love a big black one.
Marge, get away from them... what's gotten into you?
I'm going to the successful ladies room... you guys have got to help me.
If Marge leaves I'll have nothing except my many friends... and half the fortune she is now making... and will continue to make.
Homer I'm going to let you in on a secret.
I'm a first husband.
I used to look like this.
What's your secret? oh there's no secret.
Just hard work uh-huh... exercise two hours a day O.K. keep up with the latest fashions Fashions... and of course cut out all fatty foods and alcohol... uh-huh uh-huh got it.
I know just what it will take to hang onto Marge.
Mr Simpson let me outline... the gastric bypass surgery procedure for you O.K. we put the band around your stomach... so that no solid food may enter... you see just like so.
It's a very very serious operation... you should only undergo it as a last resort... please doc. I know I'm not the... greatest looking guy in the world... but I took care of my family and that used to be enough... but not anymore... very well. If you wish... we can perform the procedure in the office today. and I know how I can knock myself out.
I'll look at your bill.
Hmm I guess considering all the training you've received... this is quite reasonable.
I've never seen anything so reasonable.
It's the bargain of a lifetime.
Dad are you O.K.
I see food on your plate instead of blurring motions.
Kids your daddy underwent a special procedure... so he can be more attractive to your mother... you had your hotdog plumped.
No. I had my stomach stapled... oh all food tastes like barf now.
Homey I'm back...
Welcome home Marge.
You remembered I like romance... a smart successful woman like you... deserves the very best... you also remembered I like flattery... do you like guys who are... attractive.
Homey, you look good... all for you baby... let me get a good look at you... uh uh woah woah slow down sexy beast... why don't you take some time to savor the front... what are you hiding from me? is it chocolate.
It used to be... woah - those buns are poppin fresh... yeah, I'm going to turn off the lights now... and I'll just fold this old sweaty blanket... and put it in the closet... ow ow ow ow ow ow.
Doctor, I'm embarrassed to show my body to my wife... and it's all because of your surgery... you want me to unstaple your stomach... no I want you to give me every other surgery you have... so I can look good... and can you call it an aortic valve replacement... so my insurance will cover it... no problem.
O.K. count backwards from ten... fine I admit it I'm drunk... and so to honour her success.
I bestow upon Marge Simpson... this $100 gift card to sweat pants etcetera... did someone order a superstud? oh my implants feel itchy... yes I was out of silicone rubber... so I used rolled up socks...
... he's a monster... pitchforks everyone... monster, monster monster... monster monster... cut his heart out... listen Homer I've got to be honest with you... you better not make me cry... cause I don't know where my tear ducts are anymore.
I appreciate you trying to become more attractive for me... but the truth is.
I'm way too successful for you now.
I'm getting me a trophy husband.
I don't want to live without you Marge.
O.K.
Huh? huh? what? hey. why do I look like me again? the doctor called me about all the crazy surgeries you wanted... and I said NO. but I did have him unstaple your stomach... and turn you back into the sweet man I love.
It was all a dream?
I never became a hideous monster? the only person who thinks you're a monster... is the one who had to give you a sponge bath... and dad I hope you learned something from this.
I sure have... plastic surgery is a mistake... because it hasn't been perfected to where you look really good... when it is everyone should get it.
Amen... listen Marge, I've been wondering all these years... what is it about me that you find so irresistible? lets face it you could do better... well maybe I could... but every time I look at you.
I see the same adorable boy I fell in love with... ooohhh... well there's nothing like a happy ending.
Holy Heavens. is that a meteor heading for the earth... maybe but tonight there's a benefit... for underpaid comic book artists of the 40's and 50's to the cashbar
